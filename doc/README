Getting involved
----------------
ATK is developed in an Open Source (http://www.opensource.org) fashion in
order to facilitate collaboration on the project. One of the reasons for
choosing the Open Source method is to ensure that development is not limited
by our own resources alone.
We can also use some help in doing translations of the software and
documentation writing. If you're creative, we can also use themes.
If you want to help development, join our mailinglist by sending an empty
message to atk-subscribe@achievo.org. If you don't like mailinglists
you can also send an email to ivo@achievo.org with your suggestions.
