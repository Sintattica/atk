  so that it's easier to override and unit-test.
* Make sure we install other dependencies when handeling one. [Peter]
* Fixed atkNumberAttribute's search field, size is not limitted anymore to
  the size of the maximum allowed value which makes it possible again to
  enter ranges for the search. [Peter]
* Improved the edit and view handlers so that they explicitly only retrieve
  a single row even though the selector might return multiple. [Peter]
+ Added atkPHPView for PHP based templates which makes variables inside the
  template available as $this->varName, which will make the transition to
  Zend_View easier in the near future. [Peter]
* Fixed escaping of stack trace in Steelblue and Stillblue themes. [Peter]
+ Added atkDGList::_renderRecordActionLink(). This can be overridden to influence the
  way record actions are rendered in a datagrid. [Matthijs]
* Fixed view mode auto-link for read-only fields. [Peter]
+ Added atkViewHandler::getFormButtons() and made the view handler use it, so
  that it conforms to the way other handlers get their formbuttons. [Matthijs]
* Fixed value2db of atkBoolAttribute. [Sandy]
+ Added box template support to atkPageBuilder. [Peter]
* Fixed column support for meta node. [Peter]
* Changed the handleCancel call in atkUpdateHandler, so that it can be
  overridden in your node. [mvdvelden]
* Fixed bug in atkNode which causes attributes to be given the wrong index
  when an attribute had been removed in between. [Peter]
+ Added atkDataGrid::setMasterNode(...) which is used by the
  atkOneToManyRelation to set it's owner instance. This isn't used directly
  by the atkDataGrid itself, but can be used by modifiers or listeners. [Peter]
+ Added preAddToViewArray method to atkNode and atkAttribute which works
  similar to the preAddToEditArray methods but is invoked when creating
  the view array for the view handler. [Peter]
+ Added AMQ_WARNING message type to atkMessageQueue. [Peter]
* Fixed bug in atkMySQLiStatement which caused database errors to be
  reported as unknown error instead of the much more useful database error
  message. [Peter]
* atkError now supports printing errors based on a given exception. [Peter]
* Fixing file size check and made some validation changes so that the actual
  error is shown. [mvdvelden]
* Fixed quoting of identifiers in order by clause. It now conforms to the way
  atkquery quotes fields with multiple identifiers such as schema name and/or
  database name [Matthijs]
* Fixed quoting of identifiers in order by clause. [Peter]
* Fixed reset of atkSessionStore. [Sandy]
* Added a span around the currencysymbol of the currency attribute. [Sandy]
* Stillblue menu now has a fixed position so that it always shown even if
  you scroll down the page. [Peter]
+ Added atkAttribute::setEditCallback and atkAttribute::setViewCallback
  which can be used to register a callback for overriding the edit or
  display functionality of an attribute. [Peter]
* Sort atkNode's attribute list when the order of attributes is changed
  (and attribSort is called). [Peter]
* Add template name in HTML/XML comments when rendering templates on debug
  level 3. Makes it easy to find the origin of template HTML/XML. [Peter]
* Fixed a bug where the hidden field atkescape would contain a wrong value by
  setting the autocomplete attribute of the field to off [Matthijs]

* Fixed bug in MySQLi database driver which caused the length of fields to be a
  factor 3 of their real size if the characterset was set to UTF-8. [Peter]
* atkFieldSet now marks itself as errornous if one of it's fields contains
  errornous data. [Peter]
* Improved email validation by adding case support in the local part
  of an emailaddress in the atkEmailAttribute::validate(). [Martin]
* Fixed bug in atkDateAttribute that if no date was selected yet the day
  drop-down is empty (instead of containing options 1 to 31). [Peter]
* Added atkform.js for submitting an ATK form using an Ajax
  request. [Peter, Sandy]
* Added unique cache prefix to atkCacheTestCase in order to prevent collisions
  between simultanious runs of PHPUnit. [Guido]
* Fixed invocation of missing_module_handler. [Guido]
* Fixed bug in atkNumberAttribute. Value not posted correctly when field has
  AF_READONLY flag [Sandy, Jeroenvs]
* Fixed escaping in db2value in atkMlFckAttribute [Jeroenvs]
* Fixed SQL injection vulnerability when using atkNode::fetchByPk() [Harrie]
* When atkJSON::encode fails, try again after UTF-8 encoding of contents. [Boy]
* Fixed invoking 'delete' on attributes [mvdvelden]
* Check if the actions are set correctly in atkmultiselecthandle [dengels]
* Changed atkmanytomanyrelation for checking if a fieldname is set before
  looping through this [Patrick van der Rijst, mvdvelden]
* Changed visibility of method getCSRFToken to public [dengels]
* Rewrote a previous fix to native Javascript, rather then using PrototypeJS.
  Since this doesn't work in all situations with some IE versions [mvdvelden]
* Now returning button instead of input tags in atkController::getButton.
  Improves styling compatbility with WebKit. [Peter]
+ Added the ability to expose callbacks in PHP views. [Peter]
* Fixed alignment of recordlist th's (steelblue/stillblue) in Webkit. [Peter]
* Introduced "setShowDetailsLink" Allowing you to hide the "details" link after
  the items of a atkManyBoolRelation attribute. [mvdvelden]
* atkFileAttribute, don't display current file in add mode. [Peter]
* Changed the way the form is detected when dealing with attribute dependencies.
  This feature now supports multiple forms on one page. [mvdvelden]
* Implemented CSRF protection for save, update and delete handlers. [peter]
* atkHiddenAttribute now always renders itself in add mode too [mvdvelden]
+ Added atkAdminHandler::getAddUrl(). This method is used by
  atkAdminHandler::getAddLink() for determining the node to use for creating
  the add link. getAddUrl can be
  overridden in the handler or in the node to provide a custom url for the
  add link. [Matthijs]
+ Added atkAdminHandler::getAddNodeType(). This method is used by
  atkAdminHandler::getAddLink() and atkAdminHandler::addPage() for determining
  the node to use for creating the add link or form. getAddNodeType can be
  overridden in the handler or in the node to provide a custom node for the
  add link or form. [Matthijs]

  input element can be set using the function setAutoCompleteSize($size).
  [Patrick]

Changes in ATK 6.5.0
--------------------
* Fixing a Javascript bug, causing various IE versions to break when using
  the calendar popup [mvdvelden]
+ Added atkLanguage::setSupportedLanguages which makes it more easy to write
  tests for a certain language, but can also be used to explicitly set the
  supported languages instead of relying on auto-detection. [Peter]
* Use proper labels for atkManyBoolRelation which makes selecting checkboxes
  much easier. [Peter]
* Making atkonetoonerelation listen to tabs in view mode when the
  AF_ONETOONE_INTEGRATE is not set or when the AF_ONETOONE_RESPECT_TABS is
  set. [Melvin]
+ Added atkPage::getLoadScripts() which returns the currently loaded load
  script codes. [Peter]
+ Added $offset option to atkPage::register_load_script to register a
  script at a certain offset. [Peter]
* atkMetaPolicy::add now has a default value for the attribute type. [Peter]
* Making the autoloader work with strings with forward slashes (preg_quote 
  doesn't seem to resolve the problem). [pmatthews]
* Added $force option to atkCache::getInstance which can be used to force
  creating a new instance. Can be helpful for test-cases and such. [Peter]
* Added $fallback option to atkCache::getInstance which can be used to
  disable the graceful fallback to var cache. [Peter]
* Made atkSelectHandler also execute the modifyGrid action. [Boy]
* Fixed atkNode::validateFilter, was unable to spaces in the filter and made
  it emit warnings if it fails a filter. [Boy]
+ Added option to atkDgList to set the columns to be displayed, with support
  for atkManyToOneRelation 'list columns'. [Boy]
* atkNode::deleteDb now emits a warning if there is nothing to delete. [Boy]
+ Added atkConfig::setGlobal and atkConfig::getGlobal to set and get the
  value of global configuration parameters. [Peter]
+ Added support for specifying a database driver outside atk/db using a fully 
  qualified ATK class path. [Peter]
+ Added full support for PHPUnit based tests, for detailed information on
  setting things up see atk/skel-tests/README. [Peter]
- Removed SimpleTest, please note that this change is in no way backwards
  compatible. If you need to run SimpleTest tests you should use an older
  version of ATK or migrate your tests to PHPUnit. [Peter]
* Separating the generate link logic from the display record logic in the
  atkmanytomanyselectrelation with the aim of allowing link customisation 
  [pmatthews]
* Made atkFileAttribute::getFiles throw an error if the directory is not 
  readable. [Boy]
+ Added atkFileUtils::getFileMimetype, to get the mimetype of a file using
  the fileinfo extension or mime_content_type function. [Boy]
* Always displaying newlines for destination descriptors 
  in atkmanytomanyselectrelation [pmatthews]
* Don't show relations as link in list mode for atkManyToOneRelations with
  AF_MANYTOONE_AUTOLINK flag (only in view/edit mode). [Peter]
* Fixing atknode->validateFilter to cope with more complex queries and not 
  break if a table.column is used in a query but not as the first field 
  refferenced [pmatthews]
+ Adding visual prompt to orderable class.atkmanytomanyselectrelation.inc
  Defaults to images/up-down.gif, overrideable. [pmatthews]
* Exposed getAddURL as protected method on atkOneToManyRelation, allowing
  you to change the URL that is used as the 'add a new x'. [Boy]
* Filtering the results displayed in the manytomanyselectrelation so you don't
  get multiple entries for the same relation. This ususally happens when you
  add more than one result between saving. [pmatthews]
* Fixed the lack of support for NF_NO_ADD and NF_NO_DELETE 
  on atkmanytomanyselectrelation. [pmatthews]
* Fixed atkDirectoryTraverser warnings on reading unreadable dirs. [Dennis]
+ Set the time locale based on the locale specified in the language file. [Peter]
* Changed default charset for "nl" to UTF-8. [Peter]
* Added record caching to atkViewEditBase::getRecord(). The record is now cached
  as long as the handler instance exists, unless we call getRecord with a  
  boolean true argument. This forces the record to be fetched again. [Matthijs]
+ Added setSalt and getSalt methods to the atkPasswordAttribute to allow using
  a salt when encoding the passwords [Harrie]
* Fixed atkSessionManager::stackVar so that it doesn't keep overwriting the
  current value with a request var value on subsequent calls. [Peter]
* Fixed atkGetNode/newNode to always force a lower-case node path. [Peter]
* atkMetaPolicy now throws an exception when a destination (or link) node 
  or a certain attribute class cannot be found. [Peter]
+ Added atkNode::registerRecordActionsCallback(). This makes it possible to 
  manipulate the record actions for a grid from outside of a node. The 
  callback function has the same signature as atkNode::recordActions(). 
  Overriding atkNode::recordActions() is also still possible. [Matthijs]
+ Added atkAttribute::addDependency which replaces atkAttribute::addDependee
  and allows you to register a callback which is both called on the initial
  add/edit form generation and when the attribute changes value. The
  callback is passed a special helper object which allows you to use PHP
  calls to hide, show and/or refresh one or more attributes or output
  JavaScript code which does some more DOM modifications. [Peter]
* Deprecated atkAttribute::addDependee, for now it will create a dependency
  with a callback which refreshes the depended attribute. [Peter]
+ Added atkAttribute::preAddToEditArray which can be used to make some 
  last-minute modifications to the record or attribute. This makes it
  for example possible for the atkManyToOneRelation to pre-load it's
  selectable records and update the record to already select the first
  record (on add, when no default value is set and the relation is
  obligatory). This can be used by other (depended) attributes to render
  themselves based on that information. [Peter]
- Removed atkAttribute::setManualPaint because it was already been replaced
  for a while now with the attribute disabled mode. [Peter]
* Added $config_autoload_reindex_on_missing_class configuration option, to
  disable the auto re-indexing of all ATK class files when PHP detects
  a missing class. This means you should manually delete the cached 
  atktmp/classes.inc file on an ATK update or turn this option on, the
  default is off. [Peter]
+ Added support for setting a position attribute/column for a many-to-many
  select relation. When set, the selected records can be re-arranged using
  simple drag & drop and their positions are saved in the database. 
  [Paul, Peter]
+ Added MySQLi and MySQL specific escaping. [mvdvelden]
* Fixed warning when registering a custom actionHandler. [Tjeerd]
+ Added setAutoSearch() to atkManyToOneRelation and atkListAttribute. When set
  to true and the attribute is rendered onto a datagrid search form, the
  attribute will automatically refresh the datagrid it belongs when its onchange
  event occurs. [Matthijs]
* atkOneToManyRelation::storeAdd() now resets the datagrid session store after a
  successful save of the relation. Otherwise, when adding a new parent record
  in certain situations, the relation would show previously added records
  from the old session in the relation datagrid. [Matthijs]
* Changed some atkAttribute methods to return their instance for easy chaining
  of methods. [mvdvelden]
* Fixed tableExists in the mysqli driver to respect the database name when
  explicitly set in the table property of a metaNode. [mvdvelden]
+ Implemented atkRecycleBin, a listener that can be added to a node and that
  transfers deleted records to a recyclebin table. [Ivo]
* atkMetaPolicy now throws an exception if it can't detect a table for a node
  or if an explicitly set table does not exist. [Peter]
+ Added atkMetaPolicy::exists method which can be used to check if a certain
  attribute/column exists. [Peter]
+ Added atkNode::rowClass method which can be used to return (a) CSS
  class(es) for a datagrid list row based on record contents. [Peter]
+ Added atkHiddenAttribute for convenient addition of hidden fields to
  forms. [Ivo]
+ Added support for bind parameters to atkDatagrid::addFilter. [Peter/Tjeerd]
+ Added atkMetaPolicy::getAll() which can be used to easily add flags etc.
  to all attributes at once. [Peter]
* atkNode::getSearchCondition() now checks itself for the existence of
  a <attributename>_searchcondition() method for each attribute. If it exists,
  it gets called instead of <attribute>::getSearchCondition(). Until now it was
  only possible to change the render behaviour of an attribute search field with
  <attributename>_search, now we can also change the actual search condition
  that is generated for each attribute. [Matthijs]
+ Added atkExceptionHandler which handles uncaught exceptions with a call
  to atkHalt. [Peter]
- Removed atkNavigator because it isn't used anymore for a while now and
  contains old obsolete code. If you still need it make a copy and use
  an overloader. [Peter]
* atkErrorHandler now ignores suppressed warnings (e.g. using the @
  operator). If you explicitly ignore them in your code, it's your choice
  so ATK shouldn't display them in the debug output. [Peter]
+ Added atkSelector::getIndices() which returns the indices for the index
  field that are available for the currently set conditions. [Peter]
* atkSelector now supports ignoring primary key and/or force load fields
  and supports ignoring postvars (e.g. search criteria etc.) [Peter]
+ Added support for bind parameters and fetching rows one-by-one to
  atkSelector. Also refactored the atkNode::selectDb/countDb code into this
  class. These methods are now deprecated in favor of atkNode::select()
  which uses the atkSelector fluent interface. Made sure that if these methods
  are still being used that the calls get transformed to calls to
  atkNode::select() and if they are overridden that the overridden methods
  will be used by atkSelector. [Peter]
+ Added support for prepared statements. atkDb::prepare($query) let's you create
  a prepared statement which can use either anonymous ("id = ?") or named
  ("id = :id") bind parameters. By default the bind parameters are handled by
  ATK (e.g. replaced in the query with the proper values) but drivers with
  native bind parameter support can use real bind parameters. [Peter]
+ Added native support for bind parameters in prepared statements for the
  atkMySQLi driver. [Peter]
+ Added method atkAttribute::setForceReload(). If set to true, the
  fetched/calculated attribute value is not overwritten by the value from
  the session. Example: an expression attribute is calculated based on data
  from a relation. If the relation is updated, we don't want the attribute value
  to be overwritten by outdated session data. [Matthijs]
* Fixed a bug in atkUpdateHandler::handleUpdateSuccess() where a
  redirect would be made to the previous stack level without replacing the
  session data. This resulted in displaying old data for some relations. This
  fix makes use of SESSION_REPLACE with levelskip 1 [Matthijs]
+ made a new array available in the edit/view form template. You can
  now use $attributes which contains all attributes by their name. The
  <attributename> notation will be depricated. [Sandy]
+ atkActionHandlers now have a setBoxTemplate to set the template from your
  custom theme that renders the action.tpl. Currently only implemented in the
  add and edit handlers. [Sandy]
* SESSION_REPLACE now supports levelskips, so we can replace multiple levels
  on the sessionstack. [Tjeerd/Peter]
* Fixed bug where atkNode::updateDb() did not pass its includes and exludes on
  to atkMlSplitter::updateMlRecords(). atkMlSplitter::updateMlRecords() now
  correctly handles provided includes and excludes. [Matthijs]
+ atkDropDownMenu now supports JavaScript calls for menuitems, simply start
  your URL with "javascript:". [Peter]
* Correctly escape atkHref url's. Please note that this change might be
  backwards incompatible in the highly unlinkely event you escape the URL
  yourself beforehand. [Peter]
* Generalized atkController::getButton so you can use it for undefined
  actions (in which case the button name will be the action name). [Peter]
* Improved atkSelector::where so that multiple calls will be ANDed together
  (something you would expect it to do anyway). [Peter]
* Log system queries (like locks, metadata retrieval etc.) separately so we
  can give a distinct query count in the debug output. At the moment only
  implemented in the MySQLi driver. [Peter]
* Don't display menu and top bar for frameless themes if the request
  parameters contain the request parameter atknonav. [Peter]
* Fixed bug in atkUpdatedByAttribute for displaying the correct user in
  add/edit display mode. [Peter]
* Made SQL where clause checker aware that some parameters might be arrays
  instead of a single value. [Peter]
* Bug fixed that caused atkUpdateStampAttribute and atkCreatedStampAttribute to
  cause 'field is required' errors when the AF_OBLIGATORY flag was set [Harrie]
+ Added atkPolymorphicOneToOneRelation to atk/relations. The usage of this
  relation type is described in a HOWTO, but wasn't available in ATK [Matthijs]
* Fixed bug in atkMySQLiDb driver which caused problems when retrieving metadata
  for tables names that contain schema information. The table and schema were
  incorrectly escaped with backticks when retrieving metadata. [Matthijs]
+ Added session manager stack garbage collector which automatically removes
  stacks that haven't been used for a certain time period (controlled by
  $config_session_max_stack_inactivity_period, default: 3600s == 1h). [Peter]
* Bug fixed session leak in atkOneToManyRelation's datagrid usage. [Peter]
* Changed the behavior of smart debugging. By default if you turn smart
  debugging on by ip or by a request key the debug level will be 0 until
  you specify a different level in the URL. [Peter]
+ Added special configuration variable "debug_enabled" which can be used to
  check if debugging is enabled even though the current level might be 0.
  This can come in handy if you want to create a debug menu which you can
  use to change the different debug levels. [Peter]
* Improved behaviour of atkDummyAttribute when setting flags in the
  meta node. [Peter]
+ Added special 'atknested' request parameter which causes ATK to instantly
  redirect to the given URL with session mode SESSION_NESTED. This can be
  used to prepend something on the stack. For example, a direct add link in
  the menu which prepends the admin action so that after the user is done
  adding the record, the user is redirected to the admin screen instead of
  getting a new empty form. [Peter]
* Fixed bug in atkMySQLiDb driver which caused problems with special table
  names that need to be escaped when retrieving metadata. [Peter]
  when retrieving table metadata. [Peter]
* Themes now support the new PHP style templates too. [Peter]
* Improved tooltip support (reminder, if you add a <node>_<column>_tooltip
  entry in your text file it will be displayed as a help text when hovering
  a special help icon). [Peter]
* Small optimization to AtkStringParser->getFields(). [Matthijs]
* Removed class AtkOneToManyRelationSessionGridHandler from file
  class.atkonetomanyrelation.inc and put it into its own file.
  Otherwise the classloader couldn't properly cache this class and
  would rebuild the class list every time. [Matthijs]
* Fixed retrieval of last insert id for the MySQLi db driver.
  In certain situations where a table with an autoincrement column is used, the
  driver would return 0 instead of the newly incremented id. [Matthijs]
+ Added atkAddHandler::setSaveAction, atkSaveHandler::setAddAction,
  atkEditHandler::setUpdateAction and atkUpdatehandler::setEditAction to
  make it more easy to use these handlers inside custom actions. [Peter]
+ [EXPERIMENTAL] Added atkAttribute::observeJS($event, $body) method which
  can be used to observe JavaScript events on attribute fields. [Peter]
* Updated PrototypeJS to version 1.6.1. [Tjeerd]
* Fixed AF_DATE_STRING support in the dateattribute. Reported by
  Arjen Tebbenhof. Thanks Arjen for providing a patch and reporting this
  issue! [Arjen Tebbenhof, Martin]
+ Added data retrieval convenience methods to atkDb (getRow, getRowsAssoc,
  getValuesAssoc) which support specifying columns to use for the key
  (or value) in the result set. [Peter, Tjeerd]
* Improved getValue and getValues methods in atkDb, now support
  both numerical and string column names. [Peter, Tjeerd]
* Fixed bug in atkDb::getValue which might have caused the retrieval of
  more rows than necessary. Please specify either you own limit in the query
  or use the new $useLimit parameter and set it to true. [Peter, Tjeerd]
* Fixed parameter order in atkText call inside the sessionmanager::stacktrace
  function. [Guido]
* Fixed atkManyToOneTreeRelation: nodes on the same level weren't rendered in
  the dropdown in edit-mode. Removed globals as well. [Sandy, Jeroen]
* Fixed invocation of missing_module_handler. [Guido]
* Fixed invocation of missing_class_handler. [Guido]

Changes in ATK 6.4.4
--------------------
* Implemented CSRF protection for save, update and delete handlers. [peter]

Changes in ATK 6.4.3
--------------------
* Fixed atkNumberAttribute's extended search. The attribute always called
  getSearchCondition which resulted in including a search for the value 0. 
  [Martin, Peter]
  
Changes in ATK 6.4.2
--------------------
* Fixed another issue with displaying the correct number of decimals for
  number attributes. The database metadata now only overwrites the number of
  decimals if they aren't explicitly set. If the database metdata specifies
  a different value than is specified in the attribute the lowest number of
  decimals is used. [Peter, Sandy]

Changes in ATK 6.4.1
--------------------
* Fix for making aktManyToOneRelations editable in the grid. [Peter]
* Fix formatting/rounding issue in atkNumberAttribute which caused values
  to be represented incorrectly. [Peter]
* Bug fix for script error in Internet Explorer in dhtml_tabs.js.php. [Peter]
* Allow specifying a default value as a numeric value in the URL for 
  atkManyToOneRelations with a single field primary key destination. [Peter]
+ Added atkEditHandler::setUpdateSessionStatus to control on which level of
  the stack the update action will be executed. [Peter]
* Made atkDataGrid only accept objects with atkNode as their parent. [Boy]
* Improved error handling for sessions, sessionLoad and sessionSave 
  now throw an exception if there is no atkSessionManager loaded. [Boy]
* Fixed atkClassLoader class detection for non-standard ATK roots. [Peter]
+ atkMySQLiDriver now retrieves and shows MySQL warnings,
  if the query has warnings and debugging is on. [Boy]
* atkDataGrid::resume now throws Exceptions if it is unable to resume.
  If a grid cannot be resumed by atkAdminHandler, atkSelectHandler &
  atkOneToManyRelation a new one will be created. [Boy]
* Removed two eval calls. [mvdvelden]

Changes in ATK 6.4.0
--------------------
* atkUI::render now supports PHP-based templates. If the template name ends 
  with ".php" PHP will be used to render the template. If the name ends with
  ".tpl" and a file with the extension ".tpl.php" exists PHP will be used, 
  otherwise Smarty will be used to render the template. [Peter]
* Updates are now nested in the session stack just like save actions. [Peter]
* Validate with atkNode::allowed if certain MRA actions are valid for a
  certain record for atkDGList. [Peter]
* Fix atkActionHandler::setRejectInfo/getRejectInfo so that the reject info
  is still available when the stack gets forked and don't clear the reject
  info anymore after reading it. This makes it possible to refresh your
  browser when you get redirect back to the add/edit action after an error
  occured. [Peter]
* atkAddHandler::getRejectInfo now accepts a parameter which you can use to
  specify that you don't want the reject info to be removed from the
  session. [Peter]
* Fixed atkDateAttribute/atkDateTimeAttribute null value selection. [Peter]
* atkSessionManager stack fork now also copies the global stack vars for the
  current stack. [Peter]
* Bug fix atkColumnConfig order by statement parser. [Peter]
* Changed the behaviour of the dateattribute. I can't expain why, nothing
  has changed recently but it suddenly returned the current date when
  you left it blank while using extended search or adding records. Causing
  the search to break and new records always contain the current date.
  Hope this change doesn't break things. If you have any issues let
  me know. [Martin]
+ Added the possibility to implement the methods handleUpdateSuccess
  and/or handleUpdateError in your node to override the normal behavior
  of atkUpdateHandler after updating a record. For example to redirect
  to something else. [Peter]
* Fixed input field size in atkNumberAttribute and atkMySQLi driver for
  numeric columns with decimals. [Peter]
+ Added new fluent interface for setting meta policy attribute properties.
  The interface allows you to modify attributes in all ways the normal meta
  policy supports, but also adds support for inserting attributes before/after
  (insertBefore/insertAfter) attributes or at the top/bottom 
  (insertAtTop/insertAtBottom) of all attributes. The interface is returned
  when calling atkMetaPolicy::get with one or more attribute names or as the
  result of a call to add, addFieldSet, hasOne and hasMany. [Peter]
* Fixed bug in atkEditHandler which allowed you to edit non-existing records
  without giving any warning whatsoever. [Peter]
* Fixed bug in atkModule::menuitem which caused menu items with an explicit
  null parent menu, not to be added to the main menu. [Peter]
* Fixed bug in meta node handeling of password attributes, which incorrectly
  always were made obligatory. [Peter]
+ Added "alwaysShowGrid" option to the atkDGList component to always show
  the list header in embed mode, even if there are no records. [Peter]
+ Added atkDataGrid::setComponentOption method to set an option for
  an existing datagrid component without having to overwrite the
  entire component definition. [Peter]
+ Added AF_ONETOONE_RESPECT_TABS flag for the atkOneToOneRelation which
  makes it possible to respect the tabs set in the master node for the
  1:1 relation in integration mode. [Peter]
+ Added methods for removing filters to atkDataGrid, e.g.
  atkDataGrid::removeFilter and atkDataGrid::removeFilters. [Peter]
+ Added an option to atkNode::countDb, atkNode::selectDb and atkSelector
  to ignore the default filters that have been set on a node. [Peter]
* atkDataGrid now makes sure that it doesn't set filters twice, when
  retrieving data for the grid, by using the new ignoreDefaultFilters() 
  switch in atkSelector. [Peter]   
* atkStringParser now has an option to disable the replacing of unknown
  fields with an empty string. This is used for record action URL's which
  can otherwise not easily contain array-based parameters. [Peter]
* $config_meta_caching is in skel/config.inc.php by default disabled because 
  if you start developing a new application, your tables are  still in flux. 
  Having this option enabled by default causes a lot of confusion. Next to 
  this the performance impact isn't huge, so even if people forget to enable 
  this option it isn't a big deal (but if you are reading this, you should 
  enable this option on production environments!). If the option is disabled 
  the debug output contains a special warning. [Peter]
* PHP 5.3 compatibility fixes. [Peter]
+ Added support for editing records in-line in a datagrid. Note: This feature 
  is still EXPERIMENTAL, at the moment there is no good validation/error 
  handeling yet. To enable this feature simply set some attributes as editable 
  using $node->setEditableListAttributes(...). [Peter]
* Make sure if someone resorts a grid on a certain column the 
  current record offset is reset to 0. [Peter]
* Added AF_BOOL_HIDE_TOOLBAR flag for atkBoolAttribute which can be
  used to hide the select all, none etc. links. [Peter]
* ATK now first searches for nodes in <module>/nodes/ and only 
  falls back to <module>/ if necessary. [Peter]
* Improved the speed of CSV imports (bug #1271) [Arjen]
* atkExportHandler now respects the current search parameters 
  (bug #1251). [Arjen, Peter]
* Fixed func_concat for OCI8 driver (bug #571). [Arjen]
* Lower attribute columns or expressions when sorting (bug #1311)
  [Arjen, Peter]
+ Added support for Microsoft's Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) 
  authentication  (bug #978). [Matthieu, Ivo]
+ Added support for displaying boolean fields as checkboxes in list/view
  mode (bug #682) [MichaelZ, Peter]
* Fixed import of certain CSV import files (bug #796). [Alfred]
+ Added support for specifying columns for attributes which can be used in
  the theme to show attributes in different columns (bug #1017) [Rik, Peter]
+ Added specific template for view actions in Steelblue theme, because IE was
  having some troubles with nested forms in the view action. [Tjeerd]
+ Added OnChangeHandler support for the atkfileattribute. [Tjeerd]
* Fixed sorting m2one relations. Switching between sort orders didn't
  work. Sorting was only possible in asc order. [Martin]
+ Added OnChangeHandler support for the atktimeattribute. [Martin]
+ Add 'showAll' atkDGList option. When true (default), the 'records per 
  page' option will have an 'all' option. [Marc]
* Fixed displaying of 'size' (integral part) of atkNumberAttribute. [Paul 
  Reid, Boy]
* Fixed displaying of large integer (non-decimals) numbers of 
  atkNumberAttribute (larger than 2147483647). [Paul Reid, Boy]
* Fixed (de)selecting rights in subgroups [Jeroen]
* Changed atkUrlEncode and atkUrlDecode functions to allow encoding a string
  9 times instead of 4. Also added some testcases to verify the expected
  behaviour of these functions. [Guido]

Changes in ATK 6.3.0
--------------------
* Massively improved API documentation. [Lineke]
* Improved translations of actions and node/action titles (you can
  now prefix the title/action with the node name just like other
  translations). [Peter]
* Fixed bug/crash in searching non numeric values with the numberattribute.
  [Martin]
+ You're now able to set a basedirectory with atktmpfile util class.
  It allows you to specify a custom directory for writing files. It
  still defaults to the atktempdir config. [Martin]
* When we dont have a session in atkController we wont try to get the stackvar
  as we get errors then [Melvin]
+ When submitting an mra action in a datagrid, the posted array of selectors
  of the selected rows is now indexed with the corresponding row indexes.
  [Patrick]
+ Added base url helper for the display function in the urlattribute.
  call the setBaseUrl() to prepend a base url like http://my.domain.com
  when using relative urls and you want to link to a different domain. [Martin]
+ Added a NO_AUTOLOAD flag that causes the attribute not to load the
  available records on a initial page load. You should use this with
  a search control and let the user search for available records. It'll
  speed-up the edit page considerably when using large recordsets. [Martin]
* Nodes can now be registered in sections so that they can be displayed
  in groups in atkProfileAttribute which don't necessarily have to be the
  modules they are part of. [Peter]
* First field focus now also supports radio buttons and checkboxes plus
  fixed a bug in the handeling of selects. [Peter]
* ATK now fully supports AUTO_INCREMENT columns in MySQL (e.g. no need for
  db_sequence table anymore). This change should be backwards compatible,
  e.g. ATK automatically detects if it can use MySQL's  auto-increment feature
  or if it should use it's own sequences, however atkAttribute::addToQuery
  has a minor change  which can cause errors in certain rare cases! [Peter]
* Bugfix in the one2many relation to remove the MRA flag of the grid in display
  mode. [Lineke]
* Added support for getting/setting a stackVar for a specified level. [Tjeerd]
* SearchHandler now redirects back to previous node/action after
  submitting/cancelling an extended search. [Tjeerd]
* Map dirchange action on the admin action for fileEditor nodes. [Tjeerd]
* Fixed handling of duplicate selectors in atkDataNode. [Peter]
* Fixed the o2m relation to respect the NF_NO_ADD flag. [Martin]
* Label select_none can now be specified on attribute level with an
  atkmanytoone relation. [Max]
* Do not merge local & skel config values, only keys. [Patrick/Tjeerd]
* Fixed cleaning/filtering numeric values in the number attribute which
  caused critical database errors when searching for illegal chars. [Martin]
* Decomposed the partial_add_process to allow customization in the savehandler
  url. [Martin]
* Added MySQL config for setting the collate that is used for
  creating tables true the atkddl. [Sandy]
* Fixed the fatal error when using  $config_supported_languages_module. [Max]
+ Added save export selection functionality.
  Set $config_enable_export_save_selection to true to enable this functionality.
  Also add the atk_exportcriteria table to your database, the mysql table
  definition for this table can be found in skel/init_mysql.sql. [Ruud, Lineke]
+ Added function for quoting of table and fieldnames. [Sandy]
+ Added Create and Drop index functions to the atkddl. [Sandy]
- Removed MySQL41 driver, use MySQLi instead. [Sandy]
* Fixed locking problem in MySQL Driver. [Sandy]
* atkColorPickerAttribute popup is now 1000 pixels wide in stead of 600. It
  would not show the "select" button because the popup was too small. [Lineke]
* The atkDatagrid now also adds filters that are set in the node. When setting
  a filter in for example the adminPage function it would not be set again
  when the datagrid was refreshed (navigating through the records or changing
  the "show" box). This would cause all records to be shown again. [Lineke]
* Added classname to atkfckattribute and made a change to
  class.atkunloadhelper.js to make sure that changes in a fckfield
  will be picked up and display a warning message when one leaves the page
  [Ruud]
* The 'cancel' button on the extended search screen now works. [Tjeerd]
+ Added sorting direction to the atkExpressionAttribute [Martijn]
+ Added function getValues to class.atkdb.inc. With this function it's
  possible to retrieve all values in a single column of a resultset. [Martijn]
+ Decomposed atkWriteLog into 2 functions atkWriteLog and atkWriteToFile,
  so the latter becomes an extra tool in atktools.inc. [Patrick]
+ Errormails are now also send before a redirect header if debug level < 2.
  [Tjeerd]
+ Added function showDirs(boolean b) to class.atkfileeditor.inc. Default
  configuration is true. [Patrick]
- Mark datatypes/ classes deprecated.
* Add dt suffix datatype classes: datatypes/atkstring -> datatypes/atkstringdt etc.
  [Marc]
* Removed function MakeFCKEditable from javascript/dhtml_tabs.js.php. It
  caused FCK keylistener to be registered twice on page load, and the purpose
  of the function seems to be obsolete due to the newer FCK version.
  Tested in FF3 and IE7. [Patrick]
* Make use of newer atkTriggerError in emailAttribute for triggering attribute
  errors so labels are filled correctly. [Tjeerd]
+ Added atkGetCharset() function to atkTools, it first checks the config
  default_charset and has a fallback to the charset in the language
  file. [Sandy]
* Changed all atktext('charset') calls into atkGetCharset() [Sandy]
* Fixed displaying of special chars in atkmanytoonerelation
  dropdowns [Sandy,Jeroen]
+ Added atkString class in the utils which is always loaded. It contains string
  functions that will use the mbstring extension if it's detected. If you have the
  extension and don't want to use it, you can use the config use_mbstring to turn
  it off. atkString contains at the moment functions for: strlen, substr, charAt
  strpos, strtolower, strtoupper. [Sandy]
* atkMailer class now uses atk's default charset as it's own default charset
  [Patrick]
+ Added querycounter to atkDebugger. [Tjeerd]
* ATK now tries to create the compiled templates directory when it did not
  already exist. [Marc]
* Fixed issue where in some rare occasions the selection was remembered for a
  MRA action. [Tjeerd]
+ Added initialvalue support to atkshuttlerelation. [Melvin]
* It showed a litle bit of white just below the menu logo. [Martin]
* Fixed extended search in one2many relations. [Martin]
* Do not force template compilation in the frontcontroller. [Tjeerd]
* Fixed column length support for the decimal, double and float types in the
  mysql driver. [Mvdvelden]
* Fixed the missing getDbStatus method in atkDb. [Mvdvelden]
* Fixed bug which caused the first field always to be selected after
  depended attribute refresh. [Peter]
* Fixed atkManyToManyRelation clean-up of old selected records. [Peter]
+ Added the possibility to add regex exclude patterns to atkDirectoryTraverser
  and used this feature in atkThemeCompiler. [Patrick]
* Changed the tbsooo interface to be more compatible with odt file generation
  when using the zip extension. [mvdvelden]
+ Added ability to set a different template for the tooltip for each record
  in an atkExtendableShuttleRelation. [Dennis]
* Improved support for more complex selectors in atkDataNode::getCriteria()
  [Peter, Dennis]
+ When using the configuration option "mail_redirect" in atkMailer, prefix
  the mail body to show the original recipients [Patrick]
* In atkQuery, the join condition in addJoin is moved from the where clause
  to the join clause where it belongs. [Patrick]
* Fixed forgetCriteria() and saveCriteria() from abstractsearchhandler,
  when we use transact sql db. [Yury]
* Attribute values from the request will be used by initial_values. [Peter]
+ Added atkOneToManyRelation::setUseRefKeyForFilter which can be used
  to disable the usage of the ref key as filter for the grid. This allows
  you to use a atkOneToManyRelations inside a node which has no direct
  link with the parent node (mainly for displaying stuff). [Peter]
* Fixed brackets in the count query, they are now the same as the select
  query uses. [Sandy]
* atkZip::extract no longer throws warnings when $entries is omitted when
  using 'internal' mode. This is a PHP bug work around. [mvdvelden]
* The atkNode::editArray may now return an "extra" column for fields with
  arbitrary data that needs to be passed to the edit template. [Peter]
* Empty list option can now be configured on a per node field basis. [Peter]
* Fixed searching in fields with autocompletion in  m2o relations. [Martin]
+ Added atkManyToManyListRelation::setAutoCalculateRows which makes it
  possible to turn off the default behavior of calculating the displayed
  number of rows in the list based on the available selection size. [Peter]
* Show option title in tooltip for atkExtendableShuttleRelation. [Peter]
+ Implemented display functionality for atkRadioDetailsAttribute. [Peter]
* atkManytoManySelectRelation now doesn't load the complete record anymore
  when displaying the current value. [Peter]
* Generated code for a meta node is now only displayed when debug level
  is set to 3 (and caching is turned off). [Peter]
+ atkConsoleController can now be started with --list to get a list of
  controller actions or with --debug followed by the action name to
  output log information directly on the command line. [Peter]
+ atkConsoleController now accepts the path name to a console controller
  as valid controller class (useful when using auto-completion on the
  command line). [Peter]
* Improved atkConsoleController log file output, and now logging to
  a single file per controller per day (no distinction between types). [Peter]
+ Added 'save criteria' functionality to the atkSearchHandler. This
  functionality only works when the table atk_searchcriteria is present in
  your database. Note: When you are using the atkSmartSearchHandler, please
  rename your atk_smartsearchcriteria table to atk_searchcriteria and
  add `handlertype` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL to your new table and fill this
  new field with the value 'atksmartsearchhandler'.[Martijn]
+ Added configuration option 'mail_redirect' to defaultconfig.inc.php. See
  defaultconfig.inc.php for more details. [patrick]
+ Added setter and getter for sessionStatus in atkDialog. [Arjen]
+ Added concat function in atkDb. [Sandy]
+ Added method for setting the destination node of Auto links in the
  atkManyToOneRelation. [Sandy]
+ Added setGridExcludes and getGridExcludes functions to atkonetomanyrelation.
  Using these functions it is possible to set the fields that should be
  excluded in the datagrid of the relation even if these fields don't have the
  AF_HIDE_LIST flag. The refkeys are excluded by default. Using the
  setGridExcludes function will overrule the default. [Lineke]
+ Added javascript onchange handler support to shuttle relation. [Guido]
* Fixed searching in atkManyToOneRelation in extended mode. [Martijn]
* Warn user for calls to atkNode::primaryKeyField if there is no primary key
  defined. [Max, Peter]
* Set session status for (onetomany) add (-or-copy) dialog to session_partial.
  [Arjen]
* Disabled multi-record-actions in select handler. [Peter]
* Fixed strange bug with sessions where atkSecurityManager would set
  a session with a different cookiepath and repeatedly logging in
  and logging out would cause the user to lose the ability to
  log in at all. [Boy, Harrie]
* Fixed setting the supported languages by using the config
  supported_languages. [Arjen, Dennis]
* Removed Czechoslovakia (CS) from the country definition list in
  atkCountryAttribute. [mvdvelden]
* Implemented fallback for atkConfig::get to skel/configs/.
  If a section corresponds to a module, configs from module/skel/configs
  will be used as fallbacks. [Boy, Tjeerd]
* ProfileAttribute: don't use text() function of attribute, because of auto
  module detection (e.g. actions won't translate) [Jeroen]
* Fixed atkAggregatedColumn attribute and added extra searchcondition
  when searchmode is substring. [Sandy]
* atkManyToOne relation now also searches with concat of the descriptor
  template. [Sandy]
* Changed atkMultiselectHandler to use the atkdatagrid in stead of the
  atkrecordlist functionality. [Lineke]
* atkCountryAttribute now also takes charset into account for dutch
  translations. [Lineke]
* Target url for the select link of an atkManyToOnerelation is now encoded
  so it also works for proxy servers the decode the url. [Sandy]
* Added dropdown menu to the supported menu classes in the atkmenuclass.
  [Lineke]
* atkManyToOneRelation now uses the getOrderByStatement function of the
  columnconfig class to determine the order by clause in the selectDb
  functions. [Lineke]
* Export now also takes filters from the node into account. [Lineke]
* Atkdatagrid listarray function also returns the name of the datagrid,
  fixes problem with inline editing in the datagrid. [Lineke]
* Use the getOrderByStatement function of the columnconfig class in the
  selectDb call in the view action. [Lineke]
+ Added support for multiple error handlers and added a Zend Platform
  error handler. [MarkW]
+ Added support for a custom function to determine the descriptor def in the
  getConcatFilter function in the atkmanytoonerelation. This can be used if the
  destination node overrides the descriptor function. [Lineke]
* Removed check for mode copy in the addToQuery function in the atknode. This
  can cause problems when copying a record with a onetomanyrelation.
  [Lineke]
* Changes in atkmodule to correctly determine the destination for a
  onetomanyrelation in an overloader of a metanode. [Peter,Lineke]
* Bugfix in atkmanytoonerelation autocomplete. Unescape the value of the
  innerHTML of the selection, because characters like & would be displayed
  as &amp; in the textfield. [Peter,Lineke]
* Bugfix in updatehandler when using the NF_TRACK_CHANGES flag. The select
  query to select the original record should not use the postvars. [Lineke]

Changes in ATK 6.2.0
--------------------
+ Added atkCache, see http://www.achievo.org/wiki/ATK_Cache. [Sandy]
+ Added the atkDataGrid which replaces atkRecordList for the admin and
  select handlers and the atkOneToManyRelation. The atkDataGrid allows
  browsing through records without page reloads. [Peter]
+ Added atkConsoleController for creating standardized console scripts. [Vito]
+ Added a new theme called stillblue, which is based on steelblue but with
  more workspace and frameless [Erik]
+ Added support for caching of the meta node code. This makes the meta node
  just as fast as an ordinary node. Caching is automatically turned on for meta
  nodes which either don't have a meta method defined or have their meta method
  defined as being static. During development the caching can be turned of
  by setting the new $config_meta_caching configuration option to false. [Peter]
+ Added the atkMetaCompiler which transforms the meta policy contents to code.
  If you want to use your own compiler class you can override the new
  $config_meta_compiler configuration option. [Peter]
+ Added support for setting the default value for meta node attributes using
  atkMetaPolicy's new setDefaultValue method. [Peter]
+ Added support for forcing the insertion of meta node attributes using
  atkMetaPolicy's new setForceInsert/removeForceInsert methods. [Peter]
+ Added support for setting a handler/callback for the atkMetaPolicy which
  should be called instead of the meta node's meta method, this supercedes
  the atkMetaHandler class. You can set the handler for a node by specifying
  it as a meta option either by passing it to the parent constructor or
  creating a protected instance variable called $handler. [Peter]
+ Added support for caching database table meta data. This is in addition
  to the atkMetaNode caching. [Martin]
+ Added atkPageBuilder (can be instantiated using $node->createPageBuilder())
  which provides a fluent interface for building generalized ATK pages.
  [Peter]
+ Added atkFieldSet attribute which can be used to combine attributes in
  edit/view mode. [Peter]
+ Added atkManyToManySelectRelation, a new variant of the many to many relation
  which allows you to add items to the relation using auto-completion. Useful
  for many-to-many relations which have many selectable options. [Peter]
+ Added atkRadioDetailsAttribute, displays radio buttons with options to choose
  from just like the atkRadioAttribute but allows you to use other attributes
  for detail selections once certain options are selected. [Peter]  
+ Added support for custom actions to the atkManyToManySelectRelation, also
  added the posibility to define a custom relation class for hasMany relations.
  [Erik,Peter]
+ Added a way to set a limit to the amount of elements that will be returned
  with the atkShuttle attribute. [Erik]
+ Added a function setUseThousandsSeparator to enable the thousandsseparator
  when display the number. Default no thousandsseperator is displayed. [Martijn]
+ The atkNumberAttribute and atkCurrency now supports the thousands separator.
  It's possible to add a number with a thousand seperator included. According
  to the language settings the number is converted to right format.
  The functions standardiseSeparator and translateSeparator in
  atkNumberAttribute are deprecated. [Martijn]
+ Added year sorting on the atkDateAttribute. Use setYearSorting()
  to change the sorting order of the years dropdown. [Martijn]
+ Added simple mode on the atkDateAttribute. With the simple mode enabled
  no javascript is used to update the dropdowns [Martijn]
+ atkFileEditor is now able to browse through subdirectories. [Bjorn]
+ Added support for muliple dependant attributes in a radiodetails attribute
  and added support for labels for the detail attributes. [Tjeerd]
+ Added support for destination filters in atkManyToManySelectRelation. [Tjeerd]
+ Added the ability to use multiple atkFrontControllers by defining a different
  uri key in the atkFrontController tag. This is done as shown in the following
  example: {atkfrontcontroller uri_param=myuri myuri="/module/control/action"}
  [Erik]
+ Added setNextId, nextid, clearNextId on atkMockDb to simulate nextid
  functionality [Martijn]
+ Added addFields on atkQuery to add multiple fields (with values) at once.
  [Martijn]
+ Allow setting ownerfields for ManytoMany relations [Erik, Peter]
+ Added atkEcho() function for making echo output only from cron. [Yury]
+ Added support for searching with a '/' as seperator for from/to values in a
  free text search for atkDateAttribute. [Tjeerd, Peter]
+ Added node, nodetitle, action and actiontitle as separate entries to
  the stack-trace array. (Achievo Bug 942) [Peter]
+ Added support for objects tat implement the ArrayAccess interface in
  atkStringParser and don't threat strings as an array anymore. [Peter]
+ atkCountryAttribute now has a new list type called "custom", this custom
  list can be customised by calling the new method "setList" with as parameter
  a array of country iso codes. After setting the list you can just request
  the custom list like you would with the "world" or "europe" list.
  [Erik]
+ Added unregister_style() method to atkPage to unregister a stylesheet.
  [Tjeerd]
+ atkBoolAttribute now uses getLabel for displaying it's label if it uses the
  AF_BOOL_INLINE_LABEL flag. [Tjeerd]
+ atkAttribute's HTML input box now has an id attribute by default. [Tjeerd]
+ atkCountryAttribute now includes a world shortlist that includes US+EU15
  [Erik]
+ Adding to atkaggregatedcolumn support using relation field as searching
  field. [Yury]
+ Took the file error check out of the validate function so that it can be
  called statically from outside of atkfileattribute. It returns the
  corresponding error. fetchFileErrorType($_FILES[0]['error']) [Erik]
+ Initial values are now filled as well for the destination of an
  atkOneToOnerelation during a call to initial_values. [Tjeerd,Peter]
+ Added support for image mime type validation in the atkfileattribute. [Martin]
+ Do display PHP Fatal errors when debugging is on. [Peter, Tjeerd]
+ Add 'NOT IN' and '&' to node->valiadateFilter(), so it can be used in filter
  from now. [Yury]
+ Adding getAvailableIndices() to atknavigator, so it display only available
  letter now. (bug #714) [Yury]
+ Added atkindex to $pageVars - it contain current index letter. [Yury]
+ Added 'clear_index' and 'clear_search' link to navigator, so we can clear
  search and index creteria separately. [Yury]
+ Add NF_EDITAFTERCOPY flag and handling of 'editcopy'actions - record coping
  and open for editing. (bug #524) [Yury]
+ Added ATK wrapper of the PHP iconv function - atk_iconv. Check if iconv
  function is present in the system. If yes - use it for converting string, if
  no - save string untouch and make warning about it. [Yury]
+ Added support for dialog render mode for atkViewHandler and atkAdminHandler.
  [Peter]
+ For the atkFckAttribute it is now possible to load an additional configuration
  file where you can override some of the default settings. [Tjeerd, Dennis]  
+ The attributename and nodename are now available in the editform.tpl and
  viewform.tpl templates. [Peter, Dennis]
+ Access denied pages of dialogs now also have a close button. [Dennis]
+ When registering a menuitem, the enabled parameter now also supports a
  callback function to determine wether a menu item should be enabled.
  [Peter, Dennis]
+ The fuzzyfilters in atkNode now also support the [table] string that parsed by
  the atkStringParser. [Peter, Dennis]
+ In the atkOneToManyRelation it is now possible to disable the use of
  destinationFilters when going to the add or edit action of the destination
  node. [Peter, Dennis]
+ Added the method atkNvl() to use the value of the first given argument that is
  not null. [Peter, Dennis]
+ All theme templates can now be overridden per module. [Sandy, Ivo]
+ Added AF_BOOL_INLINE_LABEL flag to display a label next to the checkbox.
  [Peter]
+ Added support for file extension validation in atkFileAttribute. [Peter]
+ Added the methods setColorMode() and getColorMode() for the
  atkColorPickerAttribute to make the colorpicker validation check based on the
  setting of the colormode. For now only two modes are supported:
  CP_COLORMODE_DEFAULT (default behaviour) and CP_COLORMODE_HEX6 (Only hex
  notations with 6 characters are valid). Also added testcase for the
  atkColorPickerAttribute. [Dennis]
+ The submit-handling of a the javascript method atkMRASubmit() can be
  overridden by proving a javascript method with the name atkMRA_<action>. Where
  action is the name of the action you wish to override. [Peter, Dennis]
+ Added method nodeTitle() to atkUI. It supports the same functionality as the
  title() method, but supports providing an object instead an atkNodeType.
  [Peter, Dennis]
+ Added method setEditFieldPrefix and getEditFieldPrefix to the atknode class.
  ATK now supports a default fieldprefix for all fields. This can be set in
  2 ways: the setEditFieldPrefix for a specific node or the
  $config_edit_fieldprefix for the complete ATK application. [Lineke]
+ Added $config_auth_loginpage option. For applications that do not
  want to use the atk login form or the htaccess box the config variable can
  contain an url to redirect to instead of displaying the login form of ATK.
  [Lineke]
+ Added scripts/ directory which contains utility scripts for building ATK
  applications. [Peter]

  not be rendered. If this is set to true, you are responsible for calling
  the attribute's edit() method to paint it on screen. [Ivo, Sandy]
+ Added setText function to atkDummyAttribute to change the text. [Sandy]
+ Added setClickableLabel to the atkRadioAttribute to turn it of
  (default this is on). [Sandy]

  [Maurice]
+ Added atkClassLoader::mountClassPath($prefix, $path) which makes it
  possible to mount paths outside the atkroot inside the class loader using
  a special prefix. [Peter]
+ Added Canadian French translation (cf.lng). [MartinR]
* atkFrontController will now register scripts and styles in child
  controllers after the main controller [Harrie]  
* Improved recordlist icon searching, an icon can now be prefixed with
  a module or module and node to make it possible to have different actions
  for the same action name for different nodes. [Peter]
* Fixed correct insertion of null values in atkFixtureManager (mainly used
  for test-cases which use a test-database / fixtures) [Peter]

  class which makes it possible to style it differently. [Peter]
* In formfocus.js, the inital text selection is cleared to prevent data loss
  on a key event. [Patrick]
* Oci8 and Oci9 drivers now support substring conditions for subqueries.
  [Peter]
* Improved early state detection of sections to get a smooth display when
  showing a tab with opened/closed sections. [Peter]
* partial_url now supports a $sessionStatus parameter so that partial URLs
  can also be executed in a separate session stack using SESSION_NEW [Peter]
* Dialogs are now executed in a separate session stack. [Peter]
* Improved order of items in partial page output; stylesheets are now

  the page from within an action. [Peter]
* Added a display method to the atkprofileattribute, it will now list the
  rights that a user has per node and module. [Erik]

  return $this->load(). [Erik]
* Fixed issue with O2M relation and persistent filters. [Tjeerd/Peter]
* Added support for setting a field separator on the multiselectattrib.
  This allows the attribute to be used with the mysql set datatype. [Martin]
* Fixed SQL error in extended search with atkNumberAttributes. [Martin]
* Minor speedup in atkimport and changed file_exists to is_readable which makes
  more sense [mvdvelden]
* Added setDir() to the fileattrib which allows setting the dir path
  after initialisation. Due to some issues with metanode caching the path
  was parsed incorrectly in the cached file. Set the path in postMeta()
  will resolve the issue but it still needs to be fixed in the metanode
  compiler. [Martin]
* Fixed the exact search mode when using the atknumberattribute. It now uses
  the equal operator correctly for exact number searches. [Martin]

  in the configfile [PeterB]
* Fixed bug in atktestcase, when using a test database the normal database

* Fixed issue with ordering in recordlist when multiple ordercolumns were
  specified. [Tjeerd]
* Fixed a possible error situation in Smarty, which caused fatal errors on some
  occasions. This was caused by a &nbsp; directly after an open tag, added 
  there for example by the FCK Editor. [Peter,Tjeerd]
* Improved atkCountryAttribute's world_countries_shortlist. [Erik]
* Added html entities to the country definitions in atkCountryAttribute and
  html_decode them before putting them in the array so that it should contain
  the right character. [Erik]
* A test will now fail if a specified class cannot be found. [Peter]
* Refactored atkDateAttribute a bit, so we don't need the include.php file to
  register it's javascript. This makes the use of class.atkdateattribute.js.inc
  deprecated. Also added a call to the onChange handler for the input field if
  the AF_DATE_STRING flag is used. [Tjeerd,Peter]

* Fixed decode in atkcustomrecordlist. [Yury]
* Added missing seconds to function atkDateTimeAttribute.datetimeArray().
  [Patrick]

  one2one child node. [Martin]
* To calculate a UTC offset you also need the datetime next to the timezone
  because of DST differences. [Tjeerd]
* Fixed atkMetaPolicy::_applyAttribute(), setting attribute flag using 
  setTypeAndParams and addFlags methods together.(bug #889) [Yury]

Changed in ATK 6.1.0
--------------------
+ Added select method to atkNode which returns an instance of the
  atkSelector class which can be used to fluently build a selectDb
  expression to retrieve a single row, all rows or the row count.
  (PHP5 only!) [Peter]
+ Added support for custom templates in the admin actions. [Ruud]
+ Added generic Ajax DHTML dialog support to ATK (see atkDialog). [Peter]
+ Added support for add dialogs. If you set the NF_ADD_DIALOG on a node you
  will be presented with a DHTML popup dialog for entering a new record
  instead of a separate page. Can also be used for atkOneToManyRelations and
  replaces the AF_ONETOMANY_EMBED functionality. Works automatically if the
  NF_ADD_DIALOG flag is set on the destination node but can also be enabled
  using the AF_ONETOMANY_ADD_DIALOG flag. Please note that this functionality
  should only be used for simple nodes with only a few attributes and no tabs
  or sections. [Dennis, Patrick, Peter]
+ Added support for "add or copy" dialogs. This special type of dialog makes it
  possible for the user to select whatever he/she want to create a new
  record or copy an existing record. The user is presented with a dropdown of
  records to select from and can also select nested atkOneToManyRelations that
  need to be included in the copy process (or not). This functionality can
  be enabled by setting the NF_ADDORCOPY_DIALOG flag on the node or by
  specifying it using the AF_ONETOMANY_ADDORCOPY_DIALOG flag on an
  atkOneToManyRelation. [Dennis, Patrick, Peter, Tjeerd]
+ Added atkExtendableShuttleRelation; a shuttle relation which can be extended
  with so called controls. Base classes for these controls are included.
  Controls can be used, for example, to filter content in fields. Will in the
  near future replace the normal atkShuttleRelation. [Tjeerd, Peter]
+ Added action caching support to atkFrontController. [Peter]

  can be used by calling the new atkNode method addDialogMRA() with
  'attributeedit' as its argument, which will render an extra button next to
  the MRA dropdown [Dennis].
+ Made it possible to extend atkTimeZoneAttribute by calling its methods non-
  static. [Tjeerd]

+ Added fluent interface (method chaining) to addFlag, removeFlag,
  addOnChangeHandler, setForceInsert, setForceUpdate, addDestinationFilter,
  addOption, removeOption and addDependee methods. [Guido]
+ Added setOptions($options, $values) method to replace the complete
  set of options/values in atkListAttribute. [Guido]
+ Added atkDb::getValue function to get a single value (first row, first
  column) from a resultset. The getValue function accepts an sql query
  string. [Guido]
+ Added setAttributeOrder method to atkNode. [Guido]
+ Added Indonesian translation. [Deus]
+ Added option to set the administrator and guest password as an md5 hash in
  the config file for a little more security. [Guido]
+ Added adminFooter() support to atkTreeNode. [Guido]

  [Patrick]
* Fixed memory leak when config_debug is -1. Added debug level -1 to
  comments in config.inc.php [Jeroen,Sandy]

+ Added function assignRecordByNodeAndSelector($nodename, $selector,
  $prefix = "") in atkDocumentWriter to allow a record to be assigned to the
  document by just supplying the nodename and selector as strings. This
  eliminates the need to do the atkGetNode, selectDb and
  assignDocumentSingleRecord calls over and over again. [Guido]
+ Added a space between the hours and minutes dropdown box of an
  atkDurationAttributes edit output. [Guido]

  basetheme (instead of the 'default' theme). Derived themes can be completely
  styled using CSS. [Ivo]
+ Added setMasterNode()/getMasterNode() to atkRecordList. This enables
  rendering of the recordlist of node X inside an action of node Y. [Ivo]

  where atktarget is the target url, atktargetvar is the variable in the
  url which will be filled according to the selected records and
  atktargetvartpl is the template which is used to fill the atktargetvar.
  [Lineke]
+ Adding atkState class to store a value as a cookie or in the session.
  [Yury, Peter, Dennis]
+ Added rl_try JavaScript function which can try multiple actions on a
  record in the recordlist. Very handy to add an onclick handler on
  recordlist items (e.g. onclick="rl_try('{$listid}', {$row.rownum},
  ['select', 'edit', 'view'], false);"). [Peter]
+ The atkQuery class now uses a fluent interface. (php5 only). [Ivo]
+ Added atkString datatype. (php5 only). [Boy]
+ Added autoload feature. ATK will now try to load classes for you if you
  forget to include them. (php5 only). [Boy]
+ The atkcustomrecordlist attribute is extended to support some standard
  export types (csv, excelcsv, html). [Patrick]
+ Added setComment function to atkradioattribute. This can be used for comments
  per option and are placed beneath each option. [Lineke]
+ Added Japanese translation (partial). (bug #506) [James]
+ Added atk.datatypes.atkarray with multidimensional replace function. [Patrick]
+ Added support for saving entered datetimes in UTC. [Peter]
+ Added atkNode::preAddToEditArray method:
  The preAddToEditArray method is called from within the editArray
  method prior to letting the attributes add themselves to the edit
  array, but after the edit record values have been collected (a
  combination of the current record, initial/edit values and the forced
  values). This makes it possible to do some last-minute modifications
  to the record data and possibly add some last-minute attributes etc.
  [Peter]
+ Added cookie data to the debug information. Also did some code cleaning.
  [Guido, Dennis]
+ Added atkTriggerError method, improves upon triggerError by extracting
  some of the fields directly from the attribute object and by reading
  the attribute's label from the attribute which makes for better
  translations in error messages. [Peter]
+ Added setInitialValue method to atkAttribute which makes it possible
  to set the intial value for an attribute without the need to implement
  the initial_values method or overriding the attribute itself. [Peter]
+ Added atkMetaPolicy::remove method to remove automatically added
  attributes. Doesn't work for manually added attributes! [Peter]
+ Added atkRegisterNodeHandlerClass which acts as a small wrapper
  around atkRegisterNodeHandler because if you want to specify a class
  you don't want to pass a reference. [Peter]
+ Added support for externaly setting the storage / load type of an
  attribute. This makes it possible to use real attributes as dummies
  (no loading or saving) in add/edit forms. [Peter]
+ Added support for showing a warning message when leaving the
  page without saving or cancelling. To enable this functionality
  please set $config_lose_changes_warning to true. [Peter]
+ Added new lesson (10) to the demo application to demonstrate ajax
  dependencies. [Ivo]
+ Added atkManyToOneRelation::setUseFilterForAddlink method to control
  whatever the destination filter should be added to the add link when
  the NF_RELATION_AUTOLINK flag is set. [Peter]
+ Added theme resource, allows you to include other Smarty theme templates
  using {include file="theme:template.tpl} syntax. The resource will make
  sure you get the correct file from the correct directory (even works for
  overrides at the theme level). [Peter]
+ Added support for showing debug messages for Ajax requests. [Peter]
+ Added support for module specific help files (in help/ subdir of module).
  [Rene, Ivo]
* Fixed CSV row count in atkImportHandler. [Peter]
* atkMetaPolicy::add, atkMetaPolicy::setType now support an array of
  attribute names as argument for the attribute name parameter. [Peter]
* atkManyToOneRelation now shows the none label when viewing the value
  read-only and nothing is selected. [Peter]
* Fixed path handling in atkTestCase when running single tests. [Patrick]
* Fixed bug in atkcustomrecordlist. When a field has the flag AF_HIDE_LIST
  it will not be visible in the csv export. [dennisjan]
* Fixed issue with O2M and M2O relations where sometimes not all possible
  values were shown. [Peter,Boy,Tjeerd]
* atkTime now only returns integers for getHours, getMinutes, etc. [Boy]
* Added ability to register modifiers. [Boy]
* Changed function exportFile for IE7. If IE => inline to attachment [Koen]
* Fixed atkSaveHandler rollback/commit behaviour. [Peter]
* Fixed atkOci8Db/atkOci9Db rollback/commit behaviour. [Peter]
* ZendPlatform 3.x session clustering id compatibility. ZP3.x uses a hyphen
  in their session id which conflicted with the isValidSessionId function.
  [Martin]
* Added file_exists() check to atkFileAttribute before calling the filesize()
  function to prevent unnecessary error messages. [Patrick]
* Fixed calendar-runner. Two different types of date field (one where you input
  the date and another one where you input the date using the date selection
  boxes could cause problems because the Calendar object was re-used). [Peter]
* Fixed export handling of (extended) search values. [Peter]
* Changed onChange event for radioattrbiute to onClick event. It still uses
  the m_onchangecode just like the other attributes. [Lineke]
* Improved attribute security, attributes can now be shown in
  edit / read-only state or hidden based on record data. [Peter]
* atkQuery conditions are now always surrounded by braces to make sure
  OR conditions in other conditions can't influence the global atkQuery
  conditions. [Peter]
* Fixed saving Embeded o2m relations using transactional databases.
  Added commit() statemement after saving. [Martin]
* Refactored some functionality from atkSecurityManager to the
  auth_interface class which allows for greater control from within
  authorization classes. [Peter]
* Fixed automatic enable/disable of recordlist checkboxes. [Peter,Martin]
* Record-level allowed check is now also being performed in the
  respective action handlers. [Peter]
* atkNode::redirect now has a parameter to immediately exit after the
  redirect. This can prevent weird side effects because the script would
  normally continue to run after the redirect. [Peter]
* atkDb::selectDb/countDb don't set distinct on by default. In most
  cases this is not needed. And the cases which do need this can turn it
  on manually using an attribute which does so. (bug #755) [Peter]
* atkTestCase:: clear node repository etc. between each test method
  because test methods may *never* influence each other. [Peter]
* If there is not selection possible for an atkManyToOneAttribute
  show the none label. Even if obligatory. [Peter]
* Improved partial refresh support for attributes. Attributes can now
  refresh an arbitrary number of fields using JavaScript code. This
  is necessary for atkOneToOneRelations etc. [Peter]
* Owner instance is now set in attributes using setOwnerInstance. [Peter]
* Improved ATK test suite output. [Peter]
* Improved default Oracle date format. [Peter]
* When field.focus fails we catch the error so the user doesn't
  see the error. [Dennis-Jan]
* Some code cleanup for the mysqli driver. [Martin]
* check constraint violations are now seen as user errors by the
  Mysqli driver. [Martin]
* atkTestSuite doesn't display notices anymore. [Peter]
* atkNode::deleteDb now properly checks if there is something to
  delete or not. [Peter]
* Fixed PHP notices in atkNumberAttribute. [Peter]
* Refactored DB cloning functionality to atkDb class. [Peter]
* A module can now specify it's default fixture path (by
  implementing getFixturePath). [Peter]* Fixtures are now
  searched for in a subdirectory of the test case if no module
  or path is specified. [Peter]
* In case of a ML node and physical_delete flag of the atkfileattribute
  the file were delete twice. But the second it generates an error.
  [Dennis-Jan]
* Changed the dispatch.php in the skel to use atkcontroller object. Note,
  the old method ($obj->dispatch) stills works but is deprecated. It is
  recommended to use the new dispatch.php from the skel directory.
  [Lineke]
* Some functional decomposition of atkSaveHandler [Maurice]
* Added the ability to override an actionHandler class in function
  atkNode::callHandler. [Maurice]
* Added notification for trigger events (eg preAdd, postAdd). [Maurice]
* Added some checks in atkSessionManager to see if the stack really contains
  an atknodetype param. [Maurice]
* Added check in atkUi::title to see if de node was really created.
  [Maurice]
* Added fieldprefix for javascript in atkmanyboolrelation. [Lineke]
* atkManyBoolRelation does not use AMDAE anymore, php now supports multi-
  dimensional arrays (might break in older php versions). [Lineke]
* atkManyToManyRelation now adds tablename before remoteKey when deleting.
  [Lineke]
* On an error atkSaveHandler now determines if it was in admin or add mode.
  A new hidden var 'atkprevaction' is posted in add and edit pages to find
  out. This fixes failed validation to display the wrong page. [Maurice]
* Function dispatch_url now checks if parameter $atkaction contains a value.
  [Maurice]
* Added atkprevaction check to _checkIntegratedSave method in
  atkonetomanyrelation which fixes an error when using the AF_ONETOMANY_EMBED
  flag which assumes that postvars other than atkaction, atknodetype,
  atkprimkey are atkattributes. [Maurice]
* Better inplementation of dispatch_url function. [Maurice]
* Moved execution of preUpdate trigger to begin of updateDb function. This
  way changing the record in the preUpdate function will have effect.
  [Lineke]
* It is now possible to change the php_file to which is posted in forms.
  [Lineke]
* atkShuttleRelation does not use AMDAE anymore, php now supports multi-
  dimensional arrays (might break in older php versions). [Lineke]
* Fix in atkShuttleRelation: if the field in the intermediairy node pointing
  to the destination node is a regular atkAttribute instead of an
  atkManyToOneRelation, it will now work. [Ivo]
* When updateDb fails it has to return false in stead of true. [Dennis-Jan]
* Bugfix in atknode, atkmlsplitter and atkManyToOneRelation
  (m_joinaliases removed from the code) [Sandy, Peter]
* Fix a potential php warning in atkImportHandler. [Harrie]
* Fixed minor html/4.01 transitional compatibility issue in atkPage. [Guido]
* A password should only be generated if a username is given. [Guido]
* Added the auth_enablepasswordmailer var to the template so login,tpl
  can now detect if it should show the Password forgotten button. [Guido]
* Replaced tbsooo's meth_misc_alert calls by atkerror statements to
  improve debugging. [Guido]
* Fixed bug in tbsooo which caused the SaveXmlToDoc function to fail due to
  the -u option in the zip command (thanks Dennis-Jan for pointing me into
  this direction). [Guido]
* Fixed bug in atkMssqlQuery, it no longer has an ambiguous column error
  when fields in an atkManyToOneRelation have the same name as fields in
  the master node. [Ivo]
* Fixed the atkFormatAttribute, it can now handle multiple delimiters. [Ivo]
* When encountering data that doesn't match the format in atkFormatAttribute,
  the expected format is now displayed in the error message. [Ivo]
* Fixed the login image of the macoslike theme. [Ivo]
* Bugfix: filenames need to be escaped before they are added to the db in
  the atkFileAttribute. [Sandy]
* When an atkFileAttribute is obligatory but somehow empty and no new file
  is uploaded, but an existing file is selected, the atkFileAttribute won't
  ignore this selection anymore. [Guido]
* The atkThemeCompiler should not attempt to compile a theme without the
  required themedef.inc file or without any files at all. [Guido]
* Errors shown above the debug log now also use the monospace font. [Guido]
* Entering a level in the sessionstack more than 1 level above the current
  stack top is now prevented by changing the level to the
  currenttoplevel + 1. This solves the occurance of mislocated stack data
  and/or stack gaps in this scenario. [Guido]
* The atkImportHandler would hide attributes that don't use addToQuery, but
  as long as they properly handle parseStringValue, they are usable, so this
  restriction is removed. [Ivo]
* I18N now also works for the atkMetaManyToOneRelation. [Boy]
* Made debugger pass atkLevel() as prevlevel to debug window, thereby
  making it more likely to show debugging, although still not 100%. [Boy]
* Performed some functional decomposition on atkOutput, adding the
  getDebugging and sendCachingHeaders methods. [Boy]
* Fixed PHP5 issue in Smarty Compiler (block functions). [Peter]
* The exportFile function now also sends content description, transfer
  encoding and content length headers. It also automatically detects the
  correct mime type and sends that as a header. [Boy]
* Fixed notices in meta relations, grammar and policy. [Boy]
* atkMetaPolicy now detects presence of 'is_' and 'has_ ' in fieldnames and
  automatically creates relationships. [Boy]
* atkMetaPolicy now by default makes integers with a length of 1 use the
  atkBoolAttribute, and fields named 'country' use the atkCountryAttribute.
  [Boy]
* atkMetaNodes with an NF_ML flag now automatically have an
  atkMlSelectorAttribute. [Boy]
* Made ATK ignore select queries that are built with an empty fieldset. [Boy]
* Made ATK force quoting of field names that are reserved names
  like 'from'. [Boy]
* Fixed adding of extension after 'file mangle' of atkFileAttribute. [Boy]
* Performed functional decomposition on atkDateAttribute, adding following
  methods to API: setFormatEdit, setFormatView, setDateMax, setDateMin. [Boy]
* Replaced unused default config 'javascript_confirmation' with:
  'recordlist_javascript_delete'. [Boy]
* Made embedded mode of atkOneToManyRelation work with multilanguage nodes.
  [Boy]
* Decomposed getting of HTML for embedded buttons of atkOneToManyRelation
  to _getEmbeddedButtons. [Boy]
* Fixed PHP notices and a warning in atkDateAttribute. [Guido]
* Fixed incorrect language identifier date_invalid (should be
  error_date_invalid) in atkDateAttribute. [Guido]
* The restrictions that apply to an atkPasswordAttribute should only be
  tested when a new password was entered. [Guido]
* Improved debugging and error handling in atkOpenDocumentWriter->store()
  function. [Guido]
* Only relevant attributes should be loaded/updated when generating/mailing
  a new password. [Guido]
* Added JavaScript based listener support for atkDateAttributes. [Peter]
* Added support for modifying the date range (minimum / maximum)
  of an atkDateAttribute using JavaScript. [Peter]
* Improved atkDateAttribute / calendar integration (calendar now knows
  everything it needs to know to adjust the field boxes). [Peter]
* Because the FCK editor does not always agree with tabbing and no longer
  becomes editable if you switch (only in firefox), a custom method is added
  to enable all fck-editors. [Jeroen]
* Added name element in FckEditor-code so that we can access the frame from
  the parent (code change request emailed to fckeditor.net) [Jeroen]
* Performed functional decomposition on atkAdminHandler's adminPage method,
  rendering of admin recordlist is now done by renderAdminList method. [Boy]
* If a recordlist does not have actions, and is not searchable, the action
  column is no longer shown. (bug #556, #686, #774) [Boy, Yury, Marlon, Ivo]
* Made atkQuery::create() return query object instantiated with atknew
  instead of with a normal 'new', making it possible to call it without
  first importing the query class. [Boy]
* Fixed a bug in atkNodeValidator where it didn't properly quote reserved
  names. [Boy]
* The atkFileAttribute now uses 'filename' in display instead of 'orgfilename'
  which caused the strange behaviour of still showing the file you had just
  deleted until you went out of edit mode for the record and back again. [Boy]
* If there are only 2 supported languages or less, atkMlSelectorAttribute
  hides itself. [Ivo]
* When you remove a file when the atkFileAttribute has the AF_FILE_NO_SELECT
  flag, the file will now no longer be displayed in admin pages. [Dennis-Jan]
* Loading of tabs when the first tab is not the selected one is now smoother.
  [Jeroen, Ivo]
* Fixed a lot of multi-database issues. [Peter]
* Debugger now directly looks at $_REQUEST['atkstackid'] instead of
  atkStackId() (fixes issue with lost debugger data). [Peter]
* Fixed obligatory check in metadata of oci8/9 database driver. [Peter]
* Fixed relation detection in atkOneToOneRelation. [Peter]
* Properly initialize attributes in atkMLSplitter (set owner instance
  and call init method). [Peter]
* Moved required-image from handler to template ({$field.obligatory}).
  Note that custom 'editform.tpl' templates should take this into account.
  [Ivo]
* Fixed use of cache id in delete method of atkOneToOneRelation. [Boy]
* Made atkMultiSelectAttribute's db2value method return an empty array when
  there is no value instead of an array with 1 empty value. [Boy]
* Made it possible to specify top frame height and menu frame width in themes
  with the 'frame_top_height' and 'frame_menu_width' attributes in the
  themedefinition. [Boy]
* Made app.php check wether a menu exists before attempting to instantiate
  it, if it does not exist it throws an error and renders a plain menu. [Boy]
* Fixed broken preUpdate call in updateDb (preUpdate was called after
  the update query was already created). [Peter]
* Fixed saving 0 value in atkNumberAttribute as 0 instead of NULL. [Peter]
* Removed edit/delete actions in the atkFileEditor when a file isn't
  writable. [Sandy]
* Don't add link surrounding e-mail adres if mode is "csv" in display function
  of atkEmailAttribute. [Peter]
* atkTotalizer now adds subtotals for all subtotalfields when it's the last
  record. [Sandy]
* atkOneToOneRelation: when destination record already exists, do not create a
  new row in destinationrecord [Ivo, Jeroen]
* atkOneToOneRelation now respects AF_HIDE_LIST flag if AF_ONETOONE_INTEGRATE
  flag is set. Properly prefix row attribute names for list view to prevent
  overwriting columns from the master node. [Peter]
* Search API improvements: Refactored atkNode search conditions to
  applySearchConditions() method, cleaned up some search code, made every
  column in list mode have its own search method. [Ivo]
* atkNode's setIndex method now also works on atkManyToOneRelations (uses the
  descriptor to match the alphabet). [Ivo]
* atkFileAttribute: Silently ignore that a file has already been removed when
  the AF_FILE_PHYSICAL_DELETE flag is set. [Peter]
* Tbsooo converted apostrophe (&apos; -> \') from XML file for TBS functions.
  This causes corrupt document: convert it back to &apos; in documentwriter
  [Jeroen]
* Fixed problem with tabs which caused 1:1 relation tabs not to be shown.
  [Peter]
* Performance: fixed unnecessary instantiation of 1:1 relation destinations.
  [Peter]
* By default, translation debugging is now disabled. You can use
  $config_debug_translations to enable them. [Peter]
* Changed hardcoded 'userid' to use auth_userfield config in reloadUser method
  of atkSecurityManager. [Boy]
* Updated prototype and scriptaculous to latest stable version (1.5 and 1.7).
  [Lineke,Peter]
* atkFileAttribute: fixed bug in atkFileAttribute; if AF_OBLIGATORY and
  AF_FILE_NO_SELECT flags where both set you always had to upload a new
  image. [Bart, Peter]
* atkProfileAttribute now uses getUser() instead of $g_user global. [Boy, Ivo]
* Fixed error when calling text() on an attribute that isn't added to a
  node yet. [Guido]
* Fixed problem when adding styles to old sxw format documents in
  atkOpenDocumentWriter. [Guido]
* the atkPopup target should be passed through session_url in case the
  sessionid is passed through urls. [Guido]
* If $_SESSION[atkconfig("identifier")] is not an array, we assign an empty
  array to it to prevent session initialisation errors. [Peter, Guido]
* Fixed obligatory field checking for attributes of the atkOneToOnerelation's
  destination node by merging the validation errors from the destination
  node with the ownerinstance's errors right after performing the
  validation. [Guido]
* Fixed sudden resize of editarray when the colorpicker gets focussed
  and unfocussed in the Outlook theme. [Guido]
* Fixed style problem where the first column would be stretched to almost
  the full pagewidth, while other columns need that space much more than
  the first column. [Guido]
* Fixed a problem where attributes whould be hidden from a list because
  atkNode falsely determines you do not have the tab rights needed to see
  those attributes. (bug #615) [Yury]
* Fixed performance problem due to incorrect selectDb parameter in
  atkExportHandler. [Guido]
* Fixed several PHP Notices. [Guido]
* Added ability to implement a getExportAttributeGroup($attrname) function
  in a node to implement custom grouping in atkExportHandler. [Guido]
* Fixed problem in atkOneToOneRelation causing the record not to be
  inserted when it should be. [Guido]
* Fixed deprecated text() calls. [Guido]
* Fixed problem with the serialization of select fields in the prototype
  library. [Peter]
* Fixed small bug in Smarty Compiler which causes nameless tag attributes
  to be interpreted as an integer (sometimes) even though the value is
  surrounded by quotes. Also added some fixes for invalid quotes surrounding
  attribute names. [Peter]
* Fixed bug in recordlist: added missing (empty) cell above search button
  if no records are found. [Bart]
* Fixed support for atkDateTimeAttribute in oci8 driver. (bug #596) [Renato]
* Altered phpMailer to support CC header when using mail() function. [Bart]
* Fix for corrupt OpenOffice documents generated bij tbsooo: zip -m sometimes
  caused corrupt files. -d has better results it seems. [Ivo, Jeroen]
* Moved getTable method from atkMetaNode to atkNode. [Peter]
* Fixed 'Content-Type' header in exportFile() method, so browsers can
  determine the correct file type when downloading/opening. [Jeroen]
* atkDocumentWriter: Convert bullets to ' -' (tabs mess up layout), add extra
  line after starting,bullet-list, replace bold and italic tags within
  <li></li>. [Jeroen]
* atkNode's allowed() method now also accepts a modulename in its action
  parameter (module.node.action syntax). (bug #698) [Yury]
* Fixed bug: in an atkManyToOneRelation, all destination fields would be
  loaded instead of only the ones we need. (bug #702) [Yury]
* Fixed atkManyToManyRelation's hide() method. (bug #691) [Yury]
* Fixed bug: don't add empty cell to header if search button is not
  displayed + add empty cell when recordlist orientation=right. (bug #703)
  [Bart]
* Fixed sorting in recordlists when there are atkOneToManyRelations in the
  list. (sort of, code needs improvement). [Ivo]
* When adding records for an atkManyToManyRelation based relation,
  Initial_values() should be called on the linknode, not on the destination
  node. [Guido]
* Fixed bug in atkescape which would be too sticky if escaping between
  different nodes. [Ivo]
* Fixed reference copy bug in atkColumnConfig and added testcase. (bug #717)
  [Yury]
* Improved debug message on unknown mysql database error. (bug #715) [RainerG]

* Fixed smartsearching in atkMlAttribute [Peter,Jeroen]
* Functionally decomposed showTr. [Jeroen]
* Fixed bug in atkColumnConfig which caused the setOrderBy to be
  misinterpreted. [Peter]
* Fixed OCI auto-increment/sequence information in metadata. [Peter]
* Fixed setting m_mode in atkDb. This should always be done for atkMockDb to
  work. [Lineke]
* Fixed csv export for atkNodes. [patrick]
* Changed functionality for 'count distinct' in atkMysqlQuery (count
  did not count correctly when some of the fields where NULL) [Peter]

  file in a string. [Peter]
* Added ability to add flags to atkMetaPolicy::hasMany(). [Boy]
* Fixed handling of record in embeded one-to-many relation. [Peter]
* Fixed handling of NULL values of atkNumberAttribute (and
  other attributes which specify AF_NO_QUOTES). [Peter]
* Now using the edit format for date attributes if
  AF_DATE_STRING flag is set. [Peter]
* Admin handler now uses action of node (instead of simply
  assuming action 'admin'). [Peter]
* Fixed handling of null values in db2value method of
  atkDateTimeAttribute [Peter]
* Don't display duplicate descriptors in title session backtrace. [Peter]
* Drop-down menu now checks all rights of underlying menuitems. [Peter]
* dispatch_url now also supports multi-level arrays as parameters. [Peter]
* Fixed / improved searching for atkDateAttribute. [Peter]
* Added search support to atkDateTimeAttribute (only atkDateAttribute
  based at this time). [Peter]
* Fixed title retrieval for node UI. [Peter]
* Fixed Internet Explorer support in drop-down menu. [Peter]
* Fixed handling of initial_values (where applied a second time
  if an error occured in the addition form). [Peter]
* Fixed fetchValue method of atkDateTimeAttribute. [Peter]
* Deprecated atkMail class (atk/utils). [Peter]
* Added proper ordering support to atkManyToOneRelation (depending
  on the order of the destination node). [Peter]
* Fixed that selectDb always loads the primary key fields even if they are
  not part of the includes list (or are part of the excludes list). [Peter]
* Fixed that actionhandler always takes the postvars and the partial values
  of the node (in the setNode) call, because most of the times handlers
  are called using their action_... function instead of handle. [Peter]
* Fixed db2value method of atkManyToOneRelation (now calls db2value on
  destination attributes). Warning: this change might give you
  problems if you depend on the old (incorrect) behaviour! [Peter]
* Check if a certain multi-record-action is allowed on a record. [Peter]
* Added excludes/includes option to atkNode::updateRecord function. [Peter]
* atkFileAttribute uses more complete record for filename mangling. [Peter]
* atkManyBoolRelation does not require atkManyToOneRelations in the
  intermediate node anymore. [Peter]
* Logout link in menu is now configurable. [Peter]
* Statefulness of DHTML tabs is now configurable. [Peter]
* Fixed no stat error in atkDirectoryTraverser. [Peter]
* atkListAttribute: check empty array with count instead of comparison
  to an empty array. [Peter]
* Added possibility for adding an additional deletion filter for the store()
  function of the atkmanytomanyrelation. [Dennis]
* atkTableRenderer supports adding an id field to a TD. [Dennis]
* atkManyToOneRelation can be configured to have AF_RELATION_AUTOCOMPLETE flag
  by default, by setting the value for $config_manytoone_autocomplete_default
  to true). [Dennis]
* The atkManyToOneRelation is now configured to always use auto-completion
  support if AF_LARGE flag is set. This can be overriden (application-wide) by
  setting $config_manytoone_autocomplete_large to false. (bug #411) [Peter]
* Improved placeFocus() JavaScript method (now focuses the real first
  form element, instead of a somewhat guess). [Peter]
* Fixed support for returning the newly created record for a many-to-one
  relation even after an edit-after-add action has been performed. [Peter]
* Added $mergeSelectors parameter to atkNode::confirmAction (defaults to
  true to be backwards compatible). [Peter]
* Use select mode for retrieval of records for atkManyToOneRelation. [Peter]
* Fetch descriptor fields early for atkManyToOneRelation so that they can
  be displayed in the title bar etc. [Dennis,Peter]
* A table cell can now have a Row and Col Span in the
  atkTableRenderer. [Sandy]
* Bug fix, if going from edit mode to view for the same record the current tab
  is only shown if it still exists in edit mode. [Dennis,Peter]
* Bug fix, handle saved form data at the session manager level instead on
  a lower level (which caused all sorts of problems, e.g. forgotten data,
  data that shouldn't be there etc.). [Dennis,Peter]
* If add handler is called directly the user can return to a new add form
  after saving the first one. [Dennis,Peter]
* Properly handle attribute postvars in add, save, edit and update handler
  after getting back from for example the select handler. [Dennis,Peter]
* In advanced search labels are always shown (before AF_NO_LABEL was used to
  determine if a label should be shown). [Lineke]
* Made the new 'modern' menu the default menu in new installations. [Boy]
* Fixed: Open Office document generator. On some systems unzip and zip would
  return -1 instead of 0 on succesfull completion. However, no actual
  information found on the internet to back this up). [Dennis, Guido]
* atkImportHandler now uses charset from languagefile to convert the imported
  file to the correct charset. [Lineke]
* Fixed some tests. [Sandy]
* Tests are only harvested in the testcases directory. [Sandy]
* Moved atkselector from the default sessionmembers to the pagevars as it
  should not be propagated to deeper session levels. [Dennis-Jan]
* Added ability to pass default to getAttribute method of atkTheme and made
  atkTheme search for icons with extension .png and .jpeg too, preferring
  png over gif and gif over jpeg. [Boy]
* Made atkPage output XHTML valid, made ATK support themes defining the
  doctype as a theme attribute, made ATK support a page.tpl, which is a
  general template to render a page in. [Boy]
* Made login page use login.css if available and made login form more
  XHTML compliant. [Boy]
* Added loadDispatch method to atkNode, which loads the output in atkOutput
  but doesn't actually flush anything and make it support a dispatch.tpl
  template if available. [Boy]
* Made index.php support themes with 'useframes' attribute (defaults to true),
  loading themes with this attribute set to false without frames,
  please update your index.php from atk/skel/index.php. [Boy]
* atkPlainMenu now supports themes and configurations which set a different
  'menufile' (defaults to menu.php) and different 'menu_params'
  (defaults to 'target="main"'). [Boy]
* atkPlainMenu now has getMenu member function which returns the menu without
  sending it to the output stream. [Boy]
* Made url functions session_vars and session_url output &amp; instead of &
  to ensure XHTML compliance. [Boy]
* Added atkGetModules() function. [Jeroen,Boy]
* Exporthandler now decodes export to charset in languagefile. Added parameter
  to customrecordlist to set decoding on or off. [Lineke]
* Showtitlerow checkbox is now taken into account in customrecordlist. Added
  parameter to customrecordlist to set showtitlerow. [Lineke]
* Changed display function of onetomanyrelation and manytomanyrelation to
  correctly show data in csv export (without html). [Lineke]
* Added assignExportData magic method to atkNode to add extra data to the CSV
  export. This lets you use a custom query to add extra info to the export.
  [Lineke]
* Made testreporter support finding and running the test for a single class,
  in ATK notation (module.mymodule.utils.utilclass) by using the 'class'
  REQUEST variable. If found, the framework won't traverse
  the entire application, but just check for a testcase in the underlying
  testcases directory and load that testcase up.
  Example: test.php?class=atk.ui.atkpage which will load up
  atk/ui/testcases/class.test_atkpage.inc. [Boy]
* Security: Fixed cross-site scripting (xss) vulnerability in Login screen and
  any other screen that made use of the makeHiddenPostvars method. (bug #697)
  [Ivo]
* It is only allowed to set the focus if the node allowes it. [Dennis-Jan]
* Fixed OCI db driver unique constraint information in metadata (only use the
  unique flags for fields that are unique on their own). [Peter]
* Use createQuery on the node db instance to create a query object for unique
  field set validation instead of using the default db instance. [Peter]
* atkManyToOneRelation::populate now support list of attribute names. [Peter]
* Bugfix in importhandler, mb_convert_encoding function is not always present.
  So we check if the function exists. [Lineke]
* Bugfix: atkMessageQueue messages are now also displayed in adminpages. [Ivo]
* Bugfix: atkformdata should be kept in the session because the window might
  be forked. [Jeroen,Peter]
* Remember atktab in atkformdata because it might be changed in the current
  edit session. [Jeroen,Peter]
* Bugfix: atkMysqliQuery should enclose the FROM clause in parentheses due to
  changes in MySQL 5.0.15 to make MySQL more compliant with the standard.
  See: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=13551 [Dennis]
* Fixed issue in MySQL driver which caused connections to be re-used
  even though we connect to a different database. [Peter]
* Fixed some PHP5 notices. [Peter]
* Added getAttributes function to the atkStringParser, same as getFields but
  if a relation is referenced using a dot only returns the attribute name
  before the dot. [Sandy,Peter]
* Fixed bug in the atkFileAttribute that made Apache segfault when uploading
  2 or more files (and use a template). [Sandy,Peter]
* Added array initialization in class.atkdb.inc due to PHP5 notice. [Patrick]
* AtkMlWrapper attribute clone fix: check phpversion and use right clone
  method based on this (check http://www.acko.net/node/54) [Nico]
* AtkMlWrapper getRecordForLng fix: first check if record is empty [Nico]
* Fixed: Saving a node with a atkmanytomanyrelation sometimes caused an SQL
  error. [Dennis]
* When $config_authentication is set to "none", a login box is no longer
  displayed. (bug #771) [Marlon]
* When $config_authentication is set to "none", a forced login with a username
  is no longer possible (so it becomes impossible to impersonate a
  non-existing user). (bug #772) [Marlon]
* Replaced deprecated DB_ACCESSDENIED with DB_ACCESSDENIED_DB constant in
  several drivers. (bug #640) [Ivo]
* Added missing include in atkManyToOneTreeRelation. (bug #680) [Guido]
* Bugfix: Added missing $page = &atkInstance("atk.ui.atkpage"); statement in
  atkModernMenu. (bug #778) [Guido]
* Optimized atkTheme->getIconFileFromModuleTheme when
  $this->m_theme['modulefiles'] is not set. [Guido]
* Fixed several php notices. [Guido,Ivo]
* atkQuery::betweenCondition method now supports a $quote parameter to toggle
  the use of quotes in the condition. (defaults to true). (bug #678) [Yury]
* Fixed bug when NF_CACHE_RECORDLIST was used. (bug #681) [Yury]
* When NF_EDITAFTERADD is used, the 'save' button now displays 'save and edit'
  so the user knows what will happen. (bug #684) [MichaelZ]
* Updated Italian translation. [Fabio]
* Updated Dutch translation. [Guido, Lineke. Ivo]
* Updated German translation. (bug #685) [MichaelZ]
* Fixed translation of tab names in error messages in an edit form. In such
  a message only the tab_$tabname translation was attempted, now it also
  tries to translate $tabname itself. [Guido]
* Changed display in "plain" mode for the atkManyToManyRelation and the
  atkOneToManyRelation. This displaymode will now give a comma-seperated
  list of the linked records descriptors in the destinationnode (just like
  CSV mode does). [Guido]
* Added atkiputils class which provides functions to validate ip numbers
  and convert them from strings to 32bit numbers and back. [Guido]
* Fixed AF_UNIQUE checking; an empty value for a unique field should not
  generate an error about the value not being unique. [Guido]
* Fixed validation break when a custom validate function on a node
  triggers an error. This caused errors not to be shown until the custom
  validate function didn't trigger errors anymore. [Guido]
* Added NF_TREE_AUTO_EXPAND flag to atkTreeNode. This flag causes the
  tree to be expanded automatically when loaded. [Guido]
* Changed achievo_modern and outlook themes to remove the padding/margin
  from the atkManyBoolRelation and atkOneToManyRelation display output.
  [Guido]
* Make sure Sender is set in atkMailer class so that the Return-Path header
  in the e-mail message has a proper value. [Patrick]
* Fixed selectDb optimization and php notice in atkViewHandler. [Guido]
* Updated action_admin() api in atkTreeNode. [Guido]
* Fixed pre mysql 5 problem in the dbconfigs user grants testcase. [Guido]
* atk*Db->connect should return the doConnect() result. [Guido]
* The atkMysqlDb::disconnect method now closes the MySQL link. [Marlon, Peter]
* Renamed registerNodeHandler to atkRegisterNodeHandler and renamed
  getNodeHandler to atkGetNodeHandle. Old functions are still
  available but deprecated. Also, atkRegisterNodeHandler gets handler parameter
  by reference in stead of by value. If you want to set register the name of
  the handler in stead of the object itself, you should pass the name in a
  variable. [Lineke]
* Make sure ATK really saves and loads NULL values as NULL in/from the database
  instead of empty strings. [Peter]
* atkNodeValidator should only skip the current record for unique constraints
  if the validation mode is not 'add'. [Peter]
* Fixed IE7 support for ATK drop-down menu. [Peter, Almer]
* Fixed translation of labels in the atkPrintableRecordlist. [MichaelA]
* Refactored atkNumberAttribute::getSearchCondition for re-use. [Peter]
* Fixed bug in atkDateAttribute where db instance was retrieved
  using atkGetDb instead of $this->getDb. [Peter]
* Fixed searching for dates. [Peter]
* Improved Autonumbering in the atkFileAttribute. (bug #792) [Sandy]
* Added passing of preferred extension to iconPath method
  of atkTheme. [Boy,Laurence]
* Order in atkNode::selectDb can now completely be disabled by
  passing false for the order parameter. This means even the
  default order is not used. [Peter]
* atkDateTimeAttribute atkDateAttribute and atkTimeAttribute now use NULL
  instead of 'NULL' when checking for empty fields. [Dennis, Peter]
* The default value for empty time fields in atkDateTimeAttribute has changed
  from date("H:s") to "". [Dennis]
* Fixed: The validation function of atkDateTimeAttribute now first transforms
  the datestring into an array (if it isn't allready) before passing the data
  to the validation function of dateAttribute and timeAttribute.
  This prevents the time-part of the string from being corrupted. [Dennis]
* Added an extra check in formselect.js if an action is set. [Dennis]
* Added onload script updateSelectable() in atkrecordlist.js to prevent a user
  from being able to post the MRA form without selecting an action
  first. [Dennis]
* Fixed: validateUniqueFieldSets() check did not handle manytoonrelations
  correctly. [Peter,Dennis]
* Fixed translation of 'error_uniquefieldset', 'this fields' should have
  been 'these fields'. [Dennis]
* Fixed: translation of tabs in error messages. [Dennis]
* In atkAttribute the registerDependees function is now only called if the
  attribute is not hidden. [Peter, Dennis]
* When addListColumn is called in the atkM2ORelation, the flag AF_FORCE_LOAD
  is added to the attribute itself, to make sure the added listcolumns are
  loaded. [Peter,Dennis]
* Fixed reference copy bug in atkActionHandler. The $handler parameter that is
  passed to action_...() overrides is now a true reference. [Ivo]
* Overhauled the way the atkSaveHandler handles redirects; when validation
  fails, the user is no longer redirected to hardcoded 'admin' or 'add' pages,
  but to the previous action, whichever that was. [Ivo]
* Added atkTimeZoneAttribute for selecting a timezone. Translations for each
  timezone are placed in the ATK language files. [Dennis]
* atkDateTimeAttribute now supports the combination of an atkDateAttribute
  with AF_DATE_STRING flag and the normal atkTimeAttribute. [Peter]
* atk_var_dump now uses var_dump internally so that references
  are displayed properly. [Peter]
* atkNode::editArray: fallback to postvars is only done if a field really
  is not set in the defaults record. [Peter]
* Fixed typo in test/class.atktestsuite.inc (bug #806) [Yury, Patrick]
* Fixed htmlentities bug in atkAttribute (bug #807) [Yury]
* Fixes in atkOneToOneRelation validation: Only add 'atkerror' record when 1:1
  relation contains error.  And array_merge returns 'null' when one of the
  arguments is not an array (cast to array fixes this) [Jeroen]
* Sort m_cascadingAttribs after removing an attribute.
  The loop in deleteDb will fail if keys are not successive. [Jeroen]
* Force update on attribute, when it is in the include-list of updateDb
  (if 'needsUpdate' returns false, but attribute is in $includes, update it
  anyway) [Jeroen]
* The module of an atkNode is now also available in the constructor of the node
  through the atkModule::getModuleScope() method. [Peter, Dennis]
* Refactored handling the view mode of attributes in atkAttribute, atkNode,
  atkEditHandler and atkViewHandler. Added class atkViewEditBase between the
  atkActionHandler and the atkEditHandler / atkViewHandler which contains
  methods only used by the Edit and View handlers. [Yury, Dennis, Peter]
* Refactored the tooltip functionality for attributes. [Yury]
* Sections in atkNode get an id instead of a number. [Patrick]
* Sections with only hidden attributes are hidden completely. [Patrick, Peter]
* Sections which are unhidden will appear expanded. [Patrick, Peter]
* Added atkArrayDiff which returns differences (atkArrayCompare returned true
  on differences) [Jeroen]
* $quote_style must default to ENT_COMPAT, not to null [Jeroen]
* Added ability to pass parmeters to atknew for constructor of class you are
  trying to create. [Boy]
* Improved displaying of error messages in OCI8 driver. [Boy]
* Added ability to specify interval instead of steps in atkTimeAttribute.
  [Boy]
* NF_LOCK now works when a database is used that supports transactions. [Ivo]
* Remove stripslashes from db2value in atkAttribute. It is no longer needed and
  selectDb's went wrong when fields contain slashes [Ivo, Jeroen]
* Updated FCK editor to latest version (2.41). [Harrie]
* Fixed corrupted images of outlook theme. [Dennis]
* ATK buttons now have a default class of "btn" if no explicit class has
  been specified. [Peter]
* Fixed detection of database type for atkTextAttribute. [Peter]
* Improved binding of variables in atkOci9Db driver. [Peter]
* Improved atkAttribute::partial_refresh method, now only refreshes
  if a new value has been selected for the depended field and a field
  will be still marked as erroneous after a refresh. [Peter]
* Updated some of atkImportHandler's code to the 21st century. [Peter]
* atkMessageQueue::addMessage now supports a second parameter $type
  which can be set to AMQ_SUCCESS, AMQ_FAILURE or the default
  AMQ_GENERAL depending on the kind of message. [Peter]
* {atkmessages} Smarty plug-in now fills $atkmessages with an array
  for each entry containing the message and the type (as string, e.g
  'success', 'failure' or 'general'). Updated themes to reflect this
  change. [Peter]
- Deprecated method to set the selected value for an atkListAttribute.
  Please use the setInitialValue method or the already existing
  intial_value meachanism instead. [Peter]
- Removed old treeicon code from atkTreeNode. [Guido]
- Temporarily removed the 'generate title row' checkbox in atkExportHandler as
  it isn't yet implemented. [Guido]
- Removed default theme's action_view.tpl as it basically is no different
  than the default action.tpl. [Ivo]
- Removed unused summary string ($total) from atkNavigator. [Guido]
- Removed dirty hack from atkManyToOneRelation for the return $value of
  the select handler (select link) or add handler (add link). This hack
  still exists for the classic AF_LARGE mode. [Dennis, Peter]

  longer necessary if the foreign keys have the same name as the relation
  with _id appended to it. [Ivo]

  the db connection which caused unexpected behaviour. [Martin]
* Significant performance enhancement in atkNode::searchDb(). Only string/text
  type fields are searched now. [Ivo]
* Rewrote theme engine, with the following improvements:
   + Full inheritance: themes can now derive from eachother so they only
     need to define the differences from the base theme.
   + Fully automatic theme structure scanning. Themedef.inc no longer needs
     to define which templates/styles/images etc. it implements. (bug #543)
   + Support for module specific theme files.

* Fixed bug where postDelete trigger would be called twice. [Peter, Sandy]
* The preDelete trigger will now be called separately for each (to be)
  deleted record (instead of being called only once with the complete
  recordset). THIS CHANGE IS NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE! [Peter, Sandy]
* Fixed loading of the correct tab when 'atktab' is passed in the URL. [Boy]
* Fixed loading of tests from modules outside the application root which
  would sometimes do tests twice. [Boy]
* atkManyToManyRelation based relations can now be properly hidden in forms.
  (bug #666) [Yury]    
* atkManyToManyRelation based relations now only retrieve those fields used
  in the descriptor and primary key. (bug #666) [Yury]

  the intermediary node had a separate primary key. (bug #338) [Ivo]
* Refactored atkManyBoolRelation's store(), hide(), searchCondition(),
  search() and isEmpty() methods to atkManyToManyRelation as these methods
  are not atkManyBoolRelation specific. [Ivo]

  blockers (that remove headers) may see. [Ivo]
* Link id is no longer passed to mysql error functions if it is null. [Boy]
* Fixed creating sequences in postgresql. [Sandy]
* Postgresql records are now fetched in PGSQL_ASSOC mode (only associative
  array instead of numerical indexes). This should save a lot of memory.
  For applications that rely on the numerical record indexes (EVIL!) you
  can set $config_pgsqlfetchmode = PGSQL_BOTH in your configfile. [Sandy]
* Replaced deprecated postgresql function calls with the correct calls. Note
  that the postgresql driver now requires PHP 4.2. (bug #349) [Thom]
* Added type="text/css" attribute to <style> tags. [Guido]

  destination attributes). Warning: this change might cause problems if
  you depend on the old (incorrect) behaviour! [Peter]
* Fixed reloading of descriptor fields for atkManyToOneRelations with a
  combined foreign key. [Guido]   
* Added ability to call display on atkManyToOneRelation without mode. [Boy]
* The search bar now honors <attribname>_search() overrides in nodes. 
  (bug #513) [Ivo]
* Fixed loading of existing search in atkDateAttribute. [Peter]

* The title bar of add/edit action now only shows the last 2 master record
  descriptors to prevent the window from becoming too wide. [Ivo]
* Fixed distinct count support in atkQuery (using setDistinct). [Peter]
* Fixed the ability to place an attribute on multiple tabs using the
  array("tab1", "tab2") parameter. (bug #478) [Stefano]
* Fixed the width of forms inside tabs to be 100%, for 'outlook', 'win2k'
  and 'modern' themes. [Ivo]
* Fixed double cursor declaration in tabs css file of outlook theme. [Yury]
* Generated select/count queries now have spaces between the field- and
  table names for improved readability. Side effect is that the debugoutput
  no longer causes the screen to have an overly large scrollbar. [Ivo]
* Made the colorpicker popup multilanguage. [Sandy, Guido]
* Added extra is_array check to the display function the atkdateattribute
  because the empty function doesn't work correct in the php 5.0.5 version
  (this is fixed in the php 5.1.1 as far as i can see). [Sandy]
* Fixed include order in atkDateAttribute that could cause it to be
  displayed as a text input when included before atkAttribute. [Ivo]
* Fixed bug in the countDb that used wrong var in the in_array. [Sandy]

  deleteDb() and therefor not being able to delete the record. [Martin]
* atkLanguage now transforms language param to lowercase, thus always
  expecting languagefile names and variable name to be lowercase. [Boy]
* atkUpdateAttribute now uses its parent display function to display its
  value. [Sandy]
* decodeKeyValueSet in atktools now also supports != operator. [Sandy]
* Fixed duplicates lookup which didn't work when replacing the first
  menuitem withing a submenu. [Guido]
* Fixed wrong title in confirmAction dialogs. [KevinLW]

  function. [Guido]
* The edit handler now also automatically places focus on the first input
  element available (similar to the add handler). [Guido]

  configuration values to theme, so instead of being defined as:
  $config_recordlist_orientation="left" it should be defined in the
  appropriate theme as $theme['recordlist_orientation']='left'. [Boy]
* Added AF_LIST_OBLIGATORY_NULL_ITEM flag to atkListAttribute. [Boy]
* Fixed DNS lookup in email validation in atkEmailAttribute. (bug #549) [Olav]

+ Added reloadapp(); function which can be used to reload all the frames in
  your application. [Boy]
+ Added support for user-level language support. [Boy]
+ All relationships based on atkManyToManyRelation now have better localKey
  and remoteKey detection. The use of setRemoteKey and setLocalKey is no
  longer necessary if the foreign keys have the same name with the relation
  with _id appended to it. [Ivo]
+ Added atkManyBoolRelation::setCols() method to set the number of columns
  with checkboxes. [Ivo]
+ Added new lesson (9) to demo application to demonstrate many-to-many
  relations. [Ivo]
+ Added setToolbarSet() method to atkFckAttribute to change the displayed
  toolbars. [Ivo]

  files. [Ivo]
+ Added setLabel() method to atkAttribute to override the default label. [Ivo]
+ atkNode::selectDb now performs a distinct select by default to prevent
  duplicate records from being retrieved. The $distinct parameter can be set
  to false to revert to the old behaviour. [Ivo]
+ Added ability to use overloaders for normal classes instantiated
  with atknew(). [Boy]
+ Added optional $module parameter to atkUI and atkTheme methods that retrieve 
  path information about theme files. [Ivo]
* Fixed bug in the mysql41 driver. The linkid wasn't cleared after closing
  the db connection which caused unexpected behaviour. [Martin]
* Significant performance enhancement in atkNode::searchDb(). Only string/text
  type fields are searched now. [Ivo]
* Rewrote theme engine, with the following improvements:
   + Full inheritance: themes can now derive from each other so they only need
     to define the differences from the base theme.
   + Fully automatic theme structure scanning. Themedef.inc no longer needs to
     define which templates/styles/images etc. it implements.
   + Support for module specific theme files.
   * atkTheme/atkThemeCompiler codebase is about half as big.
   * Compiled themefiles are now better human readable.

* Fixed bug where postDelete trigger would be called twice. [Peter, Sandy]
* The preDelete trigger will now be called separately for each (to be) deleted
  record (instead of being called only once with the complete recordset). THIS
  CHANGE IS NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE! [Peter, Sandy]
* Fixed loading of atktab from URL. [Boy]
* Fixed loading of tests from modules outside the application root which would
  sometimes do tests twice, with special module paths. [Boy]
* The atkdebugger is now passed an atkprevlevel of 0 instead of the originating
  atklevel (which caused it to lose it's debugging info). [Boy]
* atkMLSplitter now uses atklng variable instead of
  deprecated lng variable. [Boy]
* Fixed a notice that users with Norton Internet Security or other popup
  blockers that remove headers may see. [Ivo]
* Refactored atkManyBoolRelation's store(), hide(), searchCondition(),
  search() and isEmpty() methods to atkManyToManyRelation as these methods
  are not atkManyBoolRelation specific. [Ivo]
* Link id is no longer passed to mysql error functions if it is null. [Boy]
* Fixed creating sequences in postgresql. [Sandy]
* Postgresql records are now fetched in PGSQL_ASSOC mode (only associative
  array instead of numerical indexes). This should save a lot of memory.
  For applications that rely on the numerical record indexes (EVIL!) you
  can set $config_pgsqlfetchmode = PGSQL_BOTH in your configfile. [Sandy]
* Fixed bug in the atkManyToManyRelation if the filter isn't set. [Sandy]
* Upgrade FCKEditor (for atkFckAttribute) to version 2.2. [Ivo, Olav]

* Fixed the width of forms inside tabs to be 100%, for 'outlook', 'win2k' and
  'modern' themes. [Ivo]
* Generated select/count queries now have spaces between the field- and table
  names for improved readability. Side effect is that the debugoutput no longer
  causes the screen to have an overly large scrollbar. [Ivo]
* Made the colorpicker popup multilanguage. [Sandy]
* Added extra is_array check to they display function the atkdateattribute
  because the empty function doesn't work correct in the php 5.0.5 version
  (this is fixed in the php 5.1.1 as far as i can see). [Sandy]
* Added ability to call display on atkManyToOneRelation without mode. [Boy]

* Fixed translation of links in atkAdminHandler. [Peter]
* Fixed a bug in the m2m relation that lacked passing the table name to the
  deleteDb() and not being able to delete the record. [Martin]
* Did some code cleanup and fixed the manybool and shuttle relation by including
  the required stringparser. [Martin]
* atkLanguage now transforms language param to lowercase, thus always
  expecting languagefiles to be lowercase and have a lowercase var. [Boy]
* atkUpdateAttribute now uses it's parent display function instead
  of the value2db. [Sandy]
* decodeKeyValueSet in atktools now also supports != seperator. [Sandy]
- Removed atk/styles.css as this only belongs in themes. [Ivo]
- Default styles.css file from an application's root is no longer loaded by
  default. [Ivo]
* Fixed duplicates lookup which didn't work when replacing the first
  menuitem withing a submenu. [Guido]
* Fixed wrong title in confirmAction dialogs. [KevinLW]

Changes in ATK 5.5.0
--------------------

+ Added support for configuration file overrides by other sections. [Peter]
+ Made atkErrorHandler put notices and php5 strict errors into the atk debug
  log so developers can see them. [Guido]
+ Added validate() method to atkDateTimeAttribute so both the date and time
  parts can be validated upon input. [Lineke]

  atkDateAttribute and the atkTimeAttribute. [Lineke]
+ Added setForceUpdate() method to atkAttribute to force update of its value
  upon save. [Boy]
+ Added 'mock' database drivers for testing purposes. [Boy]

  of a specified module. [Ivo]
+ Added addFallbackModule() method to atkLanguage. [Ivo]
+ Added collapsible groups feature to atkProfileAttribute. [Harrie]

  tab of a node. [Harrie]
+ Added atkSetNode() counterpart for atkGetNode(), to set nodes to a different
  instance at runtime. [Ivo]
+ Added atkSetSecurityManager() counterpart for atkGetSecurityManager(), to set
  the securitymanager to a different instance at runtime. [Ivo]
+ Added flag AF_RELATION_NO_NULL_ITEM for atkManyToOneRelation to hide the
  select_none option. [Dennis]
+ The {atktext} smarty plugin now features parsing in arbitrary values into a
  translation by passing the translated string to a stringparser. [Ivo]
+ Added flag AF_MANYBOOL_AUTOLINK to atkManyBoolRelation which shows an add
  link which can be used to add records to the referenced node (if the user
  is allowed to do so). [Guido]
+ Added translations for critical and unknown errors. [Guido]
+ Added convenience methods text() to atkNode and atkAttribute. [Ivo, Peter]
+ Added $config["automenu"] for meta module. If set to false, the meta module
  does not add any default menuitems. Defaults to true. [Ivo]

* Moved the modifier calling functionality to atkModule. This makes it
  possible to implement a generic modifier in a module that can handle any
  node from any module. [Ivo, Guido]
* If an action has no html output, the dispatcher no longer renders an html
  page. This reduces some overhead on output-less actions such as save/update/
  delete. [Ivo]
* Fixed bug in the search functionality of the atkManyBoolRelation. [Stefano]
* Fixed translation for the title of the 'select' action. [Lineke]
* Passed along atkprevlevel to debugger window so the stack doesn't get forked
  causing the console window to draw a blank page. [Boy]
* If no link_select_node translation is found atkManyToOneRelation tries a
  generic translation of 'select_a' followed by the node name. [Boy]
* If no title_module translation is found, atkProfileAttribute will use
  the module name itself as translation. [Ivo]
* If extended searching is called directly the resultlist is nested in the
  session so after editing we return directly to the results. [Boy]
* atkTimeAttribute now properly distinguishes between '0:00' hours and empty
  values. [Ivo]

  [Lineke]
* Fixed a Smarty regular expression to support '0 params'. [Lineke]
* Fixed a bug in Smarty's core.read_cache_file.php. More information:
  http://www.phpinsider.com/smarty-forum/viewtopic.php?t=4188&highlight=
  smartytplfunc. [Lineke]
* Fixed AF_UNIQUE check in atkNodeValidator (used postvars instead of record
  for validation). [Peter]
* Fixed some outlook tree icons that were corrupted. [Lineke]
* Recordlist icon names are now assumed to be lowercase. [Ivo]
* atkTheme attributes are now case insensitive. [Ivo]
* atkOneToManyRelation now builds the referential where clause in a separate
  overridable method _getLoadWhereClause(). [Ivo]

* atkManyToOneRelation now uses primary key field as default order if no order
  was specified. [Lineke]
* The edit screen now remembers the tab the user was on for the current record
  (used to be record-independent). [Lineke]
* Fixed translation of atkDateAttribute when the current language was changed
  at runtime. [Ivo]
* Fixed memory leak with debugger set at level 2 where session would be
  stuffed with debug data. [Boy,Sandy]
* Reduced memory consumption of traces by replacing &nbsp; with plain space
  as the preformat tag already takes care of proper formatting. [Guido]
* Fixed html tag delimiters ('<' and '>') in traces being interpreted
  by the browser when present in atk_get_trace("html") output. Now they
  are replaced by html entities (&gt; and &lt; respectively). [Guido]
* Fixed various javascript errors related to showtab which sometimes
  resulted in all tabs being displayed as active. [Guido]

  instead of on the id. [Ivo]
* Moved addOnChangeHandler() to atkAttribute. [Boy]

  loading of the page for dispatch() to render. [Boy]
* Fixed bug in atkTreeNode that didn't allow the usage of string based key and
  parent fields. [Peter]
* Fixed bug in atkOneToOneRelation that caused the foreign key in the record
  to be stored to be an array instead of a value. [Boy]
