Changed in ATK 6.2
------------------
* Fix use of non-numeric keys in atkOneToManyRelation [Marc]
+ Initial values are now filled as well for the destination of an
  atkOneToOnerelation during a call to initial_values. [Tjeerd,Peter]
+ Added support for image mime type validation in the atkfileattribute. [Martin]
+ Do display PHP Fatal errors when debugging is on. [Peter, Tjeerd]
+ Add 'NOT IN' and '&' to node->valiadateFilter(), so it can be used in filter from now. [Yury]
+ Adding getAvailableIndices() to atknavigator, so it display only available
  letter now. (bug #714) [Yury]
+ Adding atkindex to $pageVars - it contain current index letter. [Yury]
+ Adding 'clear_index' and 'clear_search' link to navigator, so we can clear search and index
  creteria separately. [Yury]
+ For the atkFckAttribute it is now possible to load an additional configuration file
  where you can override some of the default settings. [Tjeerd, Dennis]
+ Add NF_EDITAFTERCOPY flag and handling of 'editcopy'actions - record coping and open for
  editing. (bug #524) [Yury]
+ Added ATK wrapper of the PHP iconv function - atk_iconv. Check if iconv function is present in
   the system. If yes - use it for converting string, if no - save string untouch
   and make warning about it. [Yury]
+ The attributename and nodename are now available in the editform.tpl and viewform.tpl
  templates. [Peter, Dennis]
+ Added support for dialog render mode for atkViewHandler and atkAdminHandler. [Peter]
+ Access denied pages of dialogs now also have a close button. [Dennis]
+ When registering a menuitem, the enabled parameter now also supports a callback function
  to determine wether a menu item should be enabled. [Peter, Dennis]
+ The fuzzyfilters in atkNode now also support the [table] string that parsed by the
  atkStringParser. [Peter, Dennis]
+ In the atkOneToManyRelation it is now possible to disable the use of destinationFilters
  when going to the add or edit action of the destination node. [Peter, Dennis]
+ Added the method atkNvl() to use the value of the first given argument that is not
  null. [Peter, Dennis]
+ All theme templates can now be overridden per module. [Sandy, Ivo]
+ Added AF_BOOL_INLINE_LABEL flag to display a label next to the checkbox. [Peter]

  make the colorpicker validation check based on the setting of the colormode. For now only two
  modes are supported: CP_COLORMODE_DEFAULT (default behaviour) and CP_COLORMODE_HEX6
  (Only hex notations with 6 characters are valid). Also added testcase for the
  atkColorPickerAttribute [Dennis]
+ The submit-handling of a the javascript method atkMRASubmit() can be overridden by proving
  a javascript method with the name atkMRA_<action>. Where action is the name of the action you
  wish to override. [Peter, Dennis]
+ Added method nodeTitle() to atkUI. It supports the same functionality as the title() method,
  but supports providing an object instead an atkNodeType. [Peter, Dennis]
+ Added method setEditFieldPrefix and getEditFieldPrefix to the atknode class.
  ATK now supports a default fieldprefix for all fields. This can be set in 
  2 ways: the setEditFieldPrefix for a specific node or the 
  $config_edit_fieldprefix for the complete ATK application. [Lineke]
+ Added $config_auth_loginpage option. For applications that do not 
  want to use the atk login form or the htaccess box the config variable can
  contain an url to redirect to instead of displaying the login form of ATK.

Changed in ATK 6.1
------------------
+ Added select method to atkNode which returns an instance of the
  atkSelector class which can be used to fluently build a selectDb
  expression to retrieve a single row, all rows or the row count.
  (PHP5 only!) [Peter]
+ Added support for custom templates in the admin actions. [Ruud]
+ Added generic Ajax DHTML dialog support to ATK (see atkDialog). [Peter]
+ Added support for add dialogs. If you set the NF_ADD_DIALOG on a node you
  will be presented with a DHTML popup dialog for entering a new record
  instead of a separate page. Can also be used for atkOneToManyRelations and
  replaces the AF_ONETOMANY_EMBED functionality. Works automatically if the
  NF_ADD_DIALOG flag is set on the destination node but can also be enabled
  using the AF_ONETOMANY_ADD_DIALOG flag. Please note that this functionality
  should only be used for simple nodes with only a few attributes and no tabs
  or sections. [Dennis, Patrick, Peter]
+ Added support for "add or copy" dialogs. This special type of dialog makes it
  possible for the user to select whatever he/she want to create a new
  record or copy an existing record. The user is presented with a dropdown of
  records to select from and can also select nested atkOneToManyRelations that
  need to be included in the copy process (or not). This functionality can
  be enabled by setting the NF_ADDORCOPY_DIALOG flag on the node or by
  specifying it using the AF_ONETOMANY_ADDORCOPY_DIALOG flag on an
  atkOneToManyRelation. [Dennis, Patrick, Peter, Tjeerd]
+ Added atkExtendableShuttleRelation; a shuttle relation which can be extended
  with so called controls. Base classes for these controls are included.
  Controls can be used, for example, to filter content in fields. Will in the
  near future replace the normal atkShuttleRelation. [Tjeerd, Peter]
+ Added action caching support to atkFrontController. [Peter]
+ Added command line support for test.php file in atk skel. [Guido]
+ Implemented caching of query results by node and filter in
  atkmanytomanyrelation to prevent multiple identical query executions
  during a single request. [Patrick, Tjeerd]
+ Added functions addOption and removeOption to 'atklistattribute' for easy
  adding and removing options from a dropdown [Jeroen]
+ Added the actionhandler attributeEditHandler which provides a dialog for
  editing one attribute for multiple records at the same time. The new action
  can be used by calling the new atkNode method addDialogMRA() with
  'attributeedit' as its argument, which will render an extra button next to
  the MRA dropdown [Dennis].
+ Made it possible to extend atkTimeZoneAttribute by calling its methods non-
  static. [Tjeerd]
+ Added atkvardump Smarty modifier for debugging template variables. [Boy]
+ Added setLanguage method to atkLanguage. [Ivo]
+ Added Smarty string resource for parsing String based templates. [Boy]
+ Added support for editing records using a DHTML popup dialog. [Dennis]

  gets executed in the window context. [Peter]
+ Added query execution time info to the debug for more accurate performance
  data in oci9 database driver. [Patrick]
+ Added getAttributeNames() method to atkNode. [Peter]
+ Added support for menu images in atkmodernmenu class. [Lineke]
+ Added a new class atkTableRendererGrouped. Renders a table with collapsable/
  expandable groups. [Edgar]
+ Added atkDataNode which can be used for nodes that don't retrieve their
  data from the database. [Peter]
+ Added atkManyToManyListRelation, a new view for the many-to-many relation
  where the selection is done using a multiple-select select element. [Peter]
+ Added rmdirRecursive to atkFileUtils to 'rm -rf' any given directory. [Jeroen]
+ Added an atkUrlVault class to protect applications against url tampering.
  Needs testing, so is not yet applied to ATK's own urls. [Ivo]
+ Added {atkdispatchfile} plugin for use in forms in Smarty templates. [Sandy]
+ Added fluent interface (method chaining) to addFlag, removeFlag,
  addOnChangeHandler, setForceInsert, setForceUpdate, addDestinationFilter,
  addOption, removeOption and addDependee methods. [Guido]
+ Added setOptions($options, $values) method to replace the complete
  set of options/values in atkListAttribute. [Guido]
+ Added atkDb::getValue function to get a single value (first row, first
  column) from a resultset. The getValue function accepts an sql query
  string. [Guido]
+ Added setAttributeOrder method to atkNode. [Guido]
+ Added Indonesian translation. [Deus]
+ Added option to set the administrator and guest password as an md5 hash in
  the config file for a little more security. [Guido]
+ Added adminFooter() support to atkTreeNode. [Guido]
* Fixed XSS vulnerability, PHP_SELF was replaced with atkSelf, which does some
  anti-XSS on PHP_SELF before returning. [Ivo]

* Fixed non-object error in atkTextAttribute. [Patrick]
* Fixed example test module in atk skel. [Guido]
* Fixed several testcases. [Guido]
* Fixed PHP notices. [Guido, Ivo]
* Added class="btn_ok" to confirm button in atkNode class by default, similar
  to the cancel button, which has class="btn_cancel". Included the class
  "btn_ok" into the style.css of the achievo_modern and steelblue themes.
  [Patrick]
* Fixed memory leak when config_debug is -1. Added debug level -1 to
  comments in config.inc.php [Jeroen,Sandy]
* Fixed Italian language file. [Fabio]
* Fixed attributes display in add screen when using an atkOneToManyRelation.
  In some cases all attributes were always hidden. [Dennis, Guido]
* atkTime datatype returns time array by default with leading zero. [Boy]
* atkDateTimeAttribute does not have an AF_SEARCHABLE flag anymore by default.
  [Peter, Dennis]
* atkDurationAttribute now supports the AF_OBLIGATORY flag again. [Ivo]
* Improved detection of clicks on the recordlist row or clicks on inputs,
  etc. in the recordlist row. [Peter]
* Moved prototype.js overrides to separate JavaScript file. [Peter]
* Removed the first preUpdate call (it was called twice due to a merge error).
  This fixes the problem that in the preUpdate the atkorgrec is not filled with
  nodes with the NF_TRACK_CHANGES flag. [Boy, Lineke]
* Refactored the atkTableRenderer (backwards compatible). Functionally
  decomposed the render method. [Edgar]

  errors can also handled by a custom errorhandler. [Wim,Martin]
+ Added atkFrontController and atkDataHolder. [Peter,Martin,Boy,Tjeerd]
+ Added wizard functionality. A wizard can be constructed containing atkNode
  classes. Class atkWizard supports all atkActions but it is mainly tested
  for add, edit and admin actions. [Maurice]
+ Added class atkController which controls which page to load and the sending
  of post and get vars. Several methods from atkNode have been moved to this
  class. Most importantly, methods for dispatching, page rendering and url
  creating are moved. [Maurice, Lineke]
+ Added getPostVar function which simply returns the _REQUEST params array
  or a specific param when a key is given as parameter. [Maurice]
+ Added atkWizardController class which is responsable for typical
  control actions for nodes being used with atkWizard. [Maurice]

  part and a part which collects all needed data for rendering.
  This way it's easy to display a recordlist in a different layout. [Wim]
+ Added pre-action support in atkNode and atkActionListener classes. [Patrick]
+ Added support to the LDAP authentication class for searching in
  multiple locations (DN's) instead of one base DN as it was previously
  [Wim].
+ Added function checkKeyDimension() in the atkManyToManyRelation class
  to fix a problem with local / remote keys being a multi-dimensional
  array which resulted in invalid queries (mostly occurred in
  combination with atkmanyboolrelation / atkshuttlerelation). [Wim]

  class for the button. [Harrie]
+ Added include/exclude parameters to atkNode::updateDb. [Peter]
+ DocumentWriter: convert Html bullets (fck-editor) to XML (tab + *)
  Only 1 level deep supported (deeper levels in html will be converted to level
  1 in the generated document). [Jeroen]
+ Added function assignRecordByNodeAndSelector($nodename, $selector,
  $prefix = "") in atkDocumentWriter to allow a record to be assigned to the
  document by just supplying the nodename and selector as strings. This
  eliminates the need to do the atkGetNode, selectDb and
  assignDocumentSingleRecord calls over and over again. [Guido]
+ Added a space between the hours and minutes dropdown box of an
  atkDurationAttributes edit output. [Guido]
+ Added AF_PASSWORD_NO_ENCODE flag for atkPasswordAttribute, allows you

  bool(ean) in the options array for a many-bool relation. [Peter]
+ Added achievo_modern theme. [Norman,Boy]
+ Added selectable records override to atkManyBoolRelation and
  atkShuttleRelation. Usage: create a function named
  <attribname>_selection($record, $mode) in your node and return
  the selectable records. [Peter]
+ Added AF_MANYTOONE_LAZY flag to atkManyToOneRelation, this flag makes it
  possible to lazy load a many-to-one record in list mode. This is required
  if your destination node uses a different database. [Bart, Peter]
+ Added some unittests. (bug #615) [Yury]
+ Added display function for fck attribute to prevent html tags from being
  encoded. [Guido]
+ Added atkIpAttribute for entering ip's (optionally with wildcards).
  [Peter, Guido]
+ Added atkGetClientIp() function for retrieving the client's ip address, this
  includes a check for webservers behind a load balancer etc. [Peter]
+ Made atkinstance() resolve the classname before using it, thereby enabling
  the use of overloaders for ATK singletons. [Boy]
+ atkFileAttribute: File mangling template can now reference all fetched
  values. Added support for <fieldname>_filename magic method in owner node
  to generate custom filenames. [Peter]

  html-table-less as possible (mostly divs and spans). It is intended as a new
  basetheme (instead of the 'default' theme). Derived themes can be completely
  styled using CSS. [Ivo]
+ Added setMasterNode()/getMasterNode() to atkRecordList. This enables
  rendering of the recordlist of node X inside an action of node Y. [Ivo]
+ Modules can now provide a custom recordlist.tpl or .css. (bug #718) [Yury]
+ Recordlist navigation now contains a summary showing current records and
  total number of records ('Record 26-50 out of 261'). (bug #710) [Yury, Ivo]
+ Added support for atkTimeAttribute in atkImportHandler. [Dennis]
+ In atkImportHandler you aren't obligated anymore to select an identifier
  field. [Dennis]
+ Added basic URL-validation to atkUrlAttribute (only performed when

  an index page which loads up your app. [Boy]
+ Added atkwarning and atknotice functions, used to add warnings and
  notices to your debug log. [Boy]
+ Added a new fileutils class where can copy a skell to a specific location
  and you can create a destination at once for example ../dir/subdir/sudir2
  [Dennis-Jan]
+ Added feature to parse a directory name by a template. [Dennis-Jan]
+ Added selected record override to atkManyToOneRelation and Usage: create
  a function named <attribname>_selected($record, $mode) in your node,
  enable AF_MANYTOONE_LAZY and return the selected record. [Peter]
+ Added true test database support incl. support for fixtures. [RenevO, Peter]
+ Added auto-completion support for many-to-one relation search. [Peter]
+ Added atkGetMimeTypeFromFileExtension to atkFileTools - to get the right
  mimetype for the given filename. [Harrie]
+ atkMysqlDb's metadata() method now supports 'database.tablename' format for
  the $table parameter. (bug #708) [Yury]
+ Added atkTagAttribute for tagging of records. [Dennis]
+ Added atkStateAttribute for selecting US states. [KevinLW]
+ Added support for specifying a node action handler using the module
  prefix for the node. [Peter]

  atkTextAttribute work.) [Ivo]
+ Refactored atkModule to make it possible to easily change the default
  node location (added method getNodeFile). [Peter]
+ Added $config_use_browser_language configuration option to control
  whatever ATK should use the browser language or the language
  specified in the configuration file. [Peter]
+ Added support for using multiple test databases in case your app.
  uses multiple development/production databases. [Peter]
+ Added support for setSequenceValue to OCI DB drivers. [Peter]
+ Added support for indexed navigation in the atkMetaNode by using
  the member variable index.
+ Added integrity violation check to atkManyToOneRelation.
  NOTE: this might cause problems if your application sometimes tries
  to save incorrect values for atkManyToOneRelation fields. [Patrick,Peter]
+ Added atkQuery::addExpression method to add arbitrary SQL expressions
  to the select statement. [Peter]
+ Added atkExpressionAttribute which makes it possible to display the
  result of arbitrary SQL expressions as an attribute. [Peter]
+ Added support for filenames without an extension in the
  atkFileAttribute. (bug #791) [Sandy]
+ Added savepoint support to ATK DB layer (only supported
  when using one of the OCI drivers for now). [Peter]
+ Added support for postMeta function which will be called after
  the meta function when the attributes have been added to the node
  (when using an atkMetaNode). [Peter]
+ Added support for passing flags as the third parameter to
  atkListAttribute. [Peter]
+ Added atkAttribute::postInit method which is called at the end of
  atkNode's init method. [Peter]
+ Added function removeFilter to atkNode. [Patrick, Dennis]
+ An attribute can now specify it's own initial value by implementing
  it's initialValue method. Note: this means you should always call
  parent::initial_values in your initial values override if you want
  to use the attribute's own initial value. [Peter]
+ Added support for atkManyToOneRelation to be able to the value of the
  primarykeyfield directly, instead of having to pass it as an
  array. [Peter, Dennis]
+ Added JSON JavaScript library for encoding / "decoding" JavaScript
  objects to JSON and vice versa. [Peter]

+ Added winxp theme. [Lineke]
+ Added atkconfig plugin for setting a smarty var with config variable.
  [Lineke]
+ Added $returnbehaviour parameter to session_form() method. [Ivo]
+ Added $levelskip parameter to atNode/atkController's feedbackUrl() methods.
  [Ivo]
+ Added atkDistinctFilter filter that can be added to a node to make all its
  queries be performed with 'distinct' clause. [Ivo]
+ Added support for more then one primary key in the atkmanytomany
  relation. [Ivo, Sandy]
+ Created atkGetUser, getUser is deprecated now. Added atkGetUserId() to
  retrieve id of currently logged-in user [Jeroen, Sandy]
+ Allowed override of mysql default columntypes by config, for example:
  $config_db_mysql_default_text_columntype = 'longtext'. [Boy]
+ Database authorisation does now support authentication to other databases
  than the default database. [Peter]

  load and delete. [Peter]
+ Added $levelskip parameter to atkNode's redirect() method [Sandy]
+ Added edit header functionality to the edit handler and the action
  template (default theme). Similar to the existing admin header
  functionality. [Patrick]
+ Adding atkTabbedPane to create subtabs on a form. [Yury]
+ Added expandable/collapsable sections.
  Usage: instead of simply specifying a tab name you can also specify it's
  section using "tab.section". [Dennis]
+ Added setInitialHidden and isInitialHidden to atkAttribute and adapted the
  edit handler accordingly. Where AF_HIDE hides the attribute completely
  (even from the source), this feature will only make the attribute invisible.
  [Patrick]
+ Added multiselecthandler. This handler shows a mra action for selecting
  multiple records, unlike the selecthandler which selects one record.
  Send atktarget, atktargetvar and atktargetvartpl to the multiselectaction,
  where atktarget is the target url, atktargetvar is the variable in the
  url which will be filled according to the selected records and
  atktargetvartpl is the template which is used to fill the atktargetvar.
  [Lineke]
+ Adding atkState class to store a value as a cookie or in the session.
  [Yury, Peter, Dennis]
+ Added rl_try JavaScript function which can try multiple actions on a
  record in the recordlist. Very handy to add an onclick handler on
  recordlist items (e.g. onclick="rl_try('{$listid}', {$row.rownum},
  ['select', 'edit', 'view'], false);"). [Peter]
+ The atkQuery class now uses a fluent interface. (php5 only). [Ivo]
+ Added atkString datatype. (php5 only). [Boy]
+ Added autoload feature. ATK will now try to load classes for you if you
  forget to include them. (php5 only). [Boy]
+ The atkcustomrecordlist attribute is extended to support some standard
  export types (csv, excelcsv, html). [Patrick]
+ Added setComment function to atkradioattribute. This can be used for comments
  per option and are placed beneath each option. [Lineke]
+ Added Japanese translation (partial). (bug #506) [James]
+ Added atk.datatypes.atkarray with multidimensional replace function. [Patrick]
+ Added support for saving entered datetimes in UTC. [Peter]
+ Added atkNode::preAddToEditArray method:
  The preAddToEditArray method is called from within the editArray
  method prior to letting the attributes add themselves to the edit
  array, but after the edit record values have been collected (a
  combination of the current record, initial/edit values and the forced
  values). This makes it possible to do some last-minute modifications
  to the record data and possibly add some last-minute attributes etc.
  [Peter]
+ Added cookie data to the debug information. Also did some code cleaning.
  [Guido, Dennis]
+ Added atkTriggerError method, improves upon triggerError by extracting
  some of the fields directly from the attribute object and by reading
  the attribute's label from the attribute which makes for better
  translations in error messages. [Peter]
+ Added setInitialValue method to atkAttribute which makes it possible
  to set the intial value for an attribute without the need to implement
  the initial_values method or overriding the attribute itself. [Peter]
+ Added atkMetaPolicy::remove method to remove automatically added
  attributes. Doesn't work for manually added attributes! [Peter]
+ Added atkRegisterNodeHandlerClass which acts as a small wrapper
  around atkRegisterNodeHandler because if you want to specify a class
  you don't want to pass a reference. [Peter]
+ Added support for externaly setting the storage / load type of an
  attribute. This makes it possible to use real attributes as dummies
  (no loading or saving) in add/edit forms. [Peter]
+ Added support for showing a warning message when leaving the
  page without saving or cancelling. To enable this functionality
  please set $config_lose_changes_warning to true. [Peter]
+ Added new lesson (10) to the demo application to demonstrate ajax
  dependencies. [Ivo]
+ Added atkManyToOneRelation::setUseFilterForAddlink method to control
  whatever the destination filter should be added to the add link when
  the NF_RELATION_AUTOLINK flag is set. [Peter]
+ Added theme resource, allows you to include other Smarty theme templates
  using {include file="theme:template.tpl} syntax. The resource will make
  sure you get the correct file from the correct directory (even works for
  overrides at the theme level). [Peter]
+ Added support for showing debug messages for Ajax requests. [Peter]
+ Added support for module specific help files (in help/ subdir of module).
  [Rene, Ivo]
* Fixed CSV row count in atkImportHandler. [Peter]
* atkMetaPolicy::add, atkMetaPolicy::setType now support an array of
  attribute names as argument for the attribute name parameter. [Peter]
* atkManyToOneRelation now shows the none label when viewing the value
  read-only and nothing is selected. [Peter]
* Fixed path handling in atkTestCase when running single tests. [Patrick]
* Fixed bug in atkcustomrecordlist. When a field has the flag AF_HIDE_LIST
  it will not be visible in the csv export. [dennisjan]
* Fixed issue with O2M and M2O relations where sometimes not all possible
  values were shown. [Peter,Boy,Tjeerd]
* atkTime now only returns integers for getHours, getMinutes, etc. [Boy]
* Added ability to register modifiers. [Boy]
* Changed function exportFile for IE7. If IE => inline to attachment [Koen]
* Fixed atkSaveHandler rollback/commit behaviour. [Peter]
* Fixed atkOci8Db/atkOci9Db rollback/commit behaviour. [Peter]
* ZendPlatform 3.x session clustering id compatibility. ZP3.x uses a hyphen
  in their session id which conflicted with the isValidSessionId function.
  [Martin]
* Added file_exists() check to atkFileAttribute before calling the filesize()
  function to prevent unnecessary error messages. [Patrick]
* Fixed calendar-runner. Two different types of date field (one where you input
  the date and another one where you input the date using the date selection
  boxes could cause problems because the Calendar object was re-used). [Peter]
* Fixed export handling of (extended) search values. [Peter]
* Changed onChange event for radioattrbiute to onClick event. It still uses
  the m_onchangecode just like the other attributes. [Lineke]
* Improved attribute security, attributes can now be shown in
  edit / read-only state or hidden based on record data. [Peter]
* atkQuery conditions are now always surrounded by braces to make sure
  OR conditions in other conditions can't influence the global atkQuery
  conditions. [Peter]
* Fixed saving Embeded o2m relations using transactional databases.
  Added commit() statemement after saving. [Martin]
* Refactored some functionality from atkSecurityManager to the
  auth_interface class which allows for greater control from within
  authorization classes. [Peter]
* Fixed automatic enable/disable of recordlist checkboxes. [Peter,Martin]
* Record-level allowed check is now also being performed in the
  respective action handlers. [Peter]
* atkNode::redirect now has a parameter to immediately exit after the
  redirect. This can prevent weird side effects because the script would
  normally continue to run after the redirect. [Peter]
* atkDb::selectDb/countDb don't set distinct on by default. In most
  cases this is not needed. And the cases which do need this can turn it
  on manually using an attribute which does so. (bug #755) [Peter]
* atkTestCase:: clear node repository etc. between each test method
  because test methods may *never* influence each other. [Peter]
* If there is not selection possible for an atkManyToOneAttribute
  show the none label. Even if obligatory. [Peter]
* Improved partial refresh support for attributes. Attributes can now
  refresh an arbitrary number of fields using JavaScript code. This
  is necessary for atkOneToOneRelations etc. [Peter]
* Owner instance is now set in attributes using setOwnerInstance. [Peter]
* Improved ATK test suite output. [Peter]
* Improved default Oracle date format. [Peter]
* When field.focus fails we catch the error so the user doesn't
  see the error. [Dennis-Jan]
* Some code cleanup for the mysqli driver. [Martin]
* check constraint violations are now seen as user errors by the
  Mysqli driver. [Martin]
* atkTestSuite doesn't display notices anymore. [Peter]
* atkNode::deleteDb now properly checks if there is something to
  delete or not. [Peter]
* Fixed PHP notices in atkNumberAttribute. [Peter]
* Refactored DB cloning functionality to atkDb class. [Peter]
* A module can now specify it's default fixture path (by
  implementing getFixturePath). [Peter]* Fixtures are now
  searched for in a subdirectory of the test case if no module
  or path is specified. [Peter]
* In case of a ML node and physical_delete flag of the atkfileattribute
  the file were delete twice. But the second it generates an error.
  [Dennis-Jan]
* Changed the dispatch.php in the skel to use atkcontroller object. Note,
  the old method ($obj->dispatch) stills works but is deprecated. It is
  recommended to use the new dispatch.php from the skel directory.
  [Lineke]
* Some functional decomposition of atkSaveHandler [Maurice]
* Added the ability to override an actionHandler class in function
  atkNode::callHandler. [Maurice]
* Added notification for trigger events (eg preAdd, postAdd). [Maurice]
* Added some checks in atkSessionManager to see if the stack really contains
  an atknodetype param. [Maurice]
* Added check in atkUi::title to see if de node was really created.
  [Maurice]
* Added fieldprefix for javascript in atkmanyboolrelation. [Lineke]
* atkManyBoolRelation does not use AMDAE anymore, php now supports multi-
  dimensional arrays (might break in older php versions). [Lineke]
* atkManyToManyRelation now adds tablename before remoteKey when deleting.
  [Lineke]
* On an error atkSaveHandler now determines if it was in admin or add mode.
  A new hidden var 'atkprevaction' is posted in add and edit pages to find
  out. This fixes failed validation to display the wrong page. [Maurice]
* Function dispatch_url now checks if parameter $atkaction contains a value.
  [Maurice]
* Added atkprevaction check to _checkIntegratedSave method in
  atkonetomanyrelation which fixes an error when using the AF_ONETOMANY_EMBED
  flag which assumes that postvars other than atkaction, atknodetype,
  atkprimkey are atkattributes. [Maurice]
* Better inplementation of dispatch_url function. [Maurice]
* Moved execution of preUpdate trigger to begin of updateDb function. This
  way changing the record in the preUpdate function will have effect.
  [Lineke]
* It is now possible to change the php_file to which is posted in forms.
  [Lineke]
* atkShuttleRelation does not use AMDAE anymore, php now supports multi-
  dimensional arrays (might break in older php versions). [Lineke]
* Fix in atkShuttleRelation: if the field in the intermediairy node pointing
  to the destination node is a regular atkAttribute instead of an
  atkManyToOneRelation, it will now work. [Ivo]
* When updateDb fails it has to return false in stead of true. [Dennis-Jan]
* Bugfix in atknode, atkmlsplitter and atkManyToOneRelation
  (m_joinaliases removed from the code) [Sandy, Peter]
* Fix a potential php warning in atkImportHandler. [Harrie]
* Fixed minor html/4.01 transitional compatibility issue in atkPage. [Guido]
* A password should only be generated if a username is given. [Guido]
* Added the auth_enablepasswordmailer var to the template so login,tpl
  can now detect if it should show the Password forgotten button. [Guido]
* Replaced tbsooo's meth_misc_alert calls by atkerror statements to
  improve debugging. [Guido]
* Fixed bug in tbsooo which caused the SaveXmlToDoc function to fail due to
  the -u option in the zip command (thanks Dennis-Jan for pointing me into
  this direction). [Guido]
* Fixed bug in atkMssqlQuery, it no longer has an ambiguous column error
  when fields in an atkManyToOneRelation have the same name as fields in
  the master node. [Ivo]
* Fixed the atkFormatAttribute, it can now handle multiple delimiters. [Ivo]
* When encountering data that doesn't match the format in atkFormatAttribute,
  the expected format is now displayed in the error message. [Ivo]
* Fixed the login image of the macoslike theme. [Ivo]
* Bugfix: filenames need to be escaped before they are added to the db in
  the atkFileAttribute. [Sandy]
* When an atkFileAttribute is obligatory but somehow empty and no new file
  is uploaded, but an existing file is selected, the atkFileAttribute won't
  ignore this selection anymore. [Guido]
* The atkThemeCompiler should not attempt to compile a theme without the
  required themedef.inc file or without any files at all. [Guido]
* Errors shown above the debug log now also use the monospace font. [Guido]
* Entering a level in the sessionstack more than 1 level above the current
  stack top is now prevented by changing the level to the
  currenttoplevel + 1. This solves the occurance of mislocated stack data
  and/or stack gaps in this scenario. [Guido]
* The atkImportHandler would hide attributes that don't use addToQuery, but
  as long as they properly handle parseStringValue, they are usable, so this
  restriction is removed. [Ivo]
* I18N now also works for the atkMetaManyToOneRelation. [Boy]
* Made debugger pass atkLevel() as prevlevel to debug window, thereby
  making it more likely to show debugging, although still not 100%. [Boy]
* Performed some functional decomposition on atkOutput, adding the
  getDebugging and sendCachingHeaders methods. [Boy]
* Fixed PHP5 issue in Smarty Compiler (block functions). [Peter]
* The exportFile function now also sends content description, transfer
  encoding and content length headers. It also automatically detects the
  correct mime type and sends that as a header. [Boy]
* Fixed notices in meta relations, grammar and policy. [Boy]
* atkMetaPolicy now detects presence of 'is_' and 'has_ ' in fieldnames and
  automatically creates relationships. [Boy]
* atkMetaPolicy now by default makes integers with a length of 1 use the
  atkBoolAttribute, and fields named 'country' use the atkCountryAttribute.
  [Boy]
* atkMetaNodes with an NF_ML flag now automatically have an
  atkMlSelectorAttribute. [Boy]
* Made ATK ignore select queries that are built with an empty fieldset. [Boy]
* Made ATK force quoting of field names that are reserved names
  like 'from'. [Boy]
* Fixed adding of extension after 'file mangle' of atkFileAttribute. [Boy]
* Performed functional decomposition on atkDateAttribute, adding following
  methods to API: setFormatEdit, setFormatView, setDateMax, setDateMin. [Boy]
* Replaced unused default config 'javascript_confirmation' with:
  'recordlist_javascript_delete'. [Boy]
* Made embedded mode of atkOneToManyRelation work with multilanguage nodes.
  [Boy]
* Decomposed getting of HTML for embedded buttons of atkOneToManyRelation
  to _getEmbeddedButtons. [Boy]
* Fixed PHP notices and a warning in atkDateAttribute. [Guido]
* Fixed incorrect language identifier date_invalid (should be
  error_date_invalid) in atkDateAttribute. [Guido]
* The restrictions that apply to an atkPasswordAttribute should only be
  tested when a new password was entered. [Guido]
* Improved debugging and error handling in atkOpenDocumentWriter->store()
  function. [Guido]
* Only relevant attributes should be loaded/updated when generating/mailing
  a new password. [Guido]
* Added JavaScript based listener support for atkDateAttributes. [Peter]
* Added support for modifying the date range (minimum / maximum)
  of an atkDateAttribute using JavaScript. [Peter]
* Improved atkDateAttribute / calendar integration (calendar now knows
  everything it needs to know to adjust the field boxes). [Peter]
* Because the FCK editor does not always agree with tabbing and no longer
  becomes editable if you switch (only in firefox), a custom method is added
  to enable all fck-editors. [Jeroen]
* Added name element in FckEditor-code so that we can access the frame from
  the parent (code change request emailed to fckeditor.net) [Jeroen]
* Performed functional decomposition on atkAdminHandler's adminPage method,
  rendering of admin recordlist is now done by renderAdminList method. [Boy]
* If a recordlist does not have actions, and is not searchable, the action
  column is no longer shown. (bug #556, #686, #774) [Boy, Yury, Marlon, Ivo]
* Made atkQuery::create() return query object instantiated with atknew
  instead of with a normal 'new', making it possible to call it without
  first importing the query class. [Boy]
* Fixed a bug in atkNodeValidator where it didn't properly quote reserved
  names. [Boy]
* The atkFileAttribute now uses 'filename' in display instead of 'orgfilename'
  which caused the strange behaviour of still showing the file you had just
  deleted until you went out of edit mode for the record and back again. [Boy]
* If there are only 2 supported languages or less, atkMlSelectorAttribute
  hides itself. [Ivo]
* When you remove a file when the atkFileAttribute has the AF_FILE_NO_SELECT
  flag, the file will now no longer be displayed in admin pages. [Dennis-Jan]
* Loading of tabs when the first tab is not the selected one is now smoother.
  [Jeroen, Ivo]
* Fixed a lot of multi-database issues. [Peter]
* Debugger now directly looks at $_REQUEST['atkstackid'] instead of
  atkStackId() (fixes issue with lost debugger data). [Peter]
* Fixed obligatory check in metadata of oci8/9 database driver. [Peter]
* Fixed relation detection in atkOneToOneRelation. [Peter]
* Properly initialize attributes in atkMLSplitter (set owner instance
  and call init method). [Peter]
* Moved required-image from handler to template ({$field.obligatory}).
  Note that custom 'editform.tpl' templates should take this into account.
  [Ivo]
* Fixed use of cache id in delete method of atkOneToOneRelation. [Boy]
* Made atkMultiSelectAttribute's db2value method return an empty array when
  there is no value instead of an array with 1 empty value. [Boy]
* Made it possible to specify top frame height and menu frame width in themes
  with the 'frame_top_height' and 'frame_menu_width' attributes in the
  themedefinition. [Boy]
* Made app.php check wether a menu exists before attempting to instantiate
  it, if it does not exist it throws an error and renders a plain menu. [Boy]
* Fixed broken preUpdate call in updateDb (preUpdate was called after
  the update query was already created). [Peter]
* Fixed saving 0 value in atkNumberAttribute as 0 instead of NULL. [Peter]
* Removed edit/delete actions in the atkFileEditor when a file isn't
  writable. [Sandy]
* Don't add link surrounding e-mail adres if mode is "csv" in display function
  of atkEmailAttribute. [Peter]
* atkTotalizer now adds subtotals for all subtotalfields when it's the last
  record. [Sandy]
* atkOneToOneRelation: when destination record already exists, do not create a
  new row in destinationrecord [Ivo, Jeroen]
* atkOneToOneRelation now respects AF_HIDE_LIST flag if AF_ONETOONE_INTEGRATE
  flag is set. Properly prefix row attribute names for list view to prevent
  overwriting columns from the master node. [Peter]
* Search API improvements: Refactored atkNode search conditions to
  applySearchConditions() method, cleaned up some search code, made every
  column in list mode have its own search method. [Ivo]
* atkNode's setIndex method now also works on atkManyToOneRelations (uses the
  descriptor to match the alphabet). [Ivo]
* atkFileAttribute: Silently ignore that a file has already been removed when
  the AF_FILE_PHYSICAL_DELETE flag is set. [Peter]
* Tbsooo converted apostrophe (&apos; -> \') from XML file for TBS functions.
  This causes corrupt document: convert it back to &apos; in documentwriter
  [Jeroen]
* Fixed problem with tabs which caused 1:1 relation tabs not to be shown.
  [Peter]
* Performance: fixed unnecessary instantiation of 1:1 relation destinations.
  [Peter]
* By default, translation debugging is now disabled. You can use
  $config_debug_translations to enable them. [Peter]
* Changed hardcoded 'userid' to use auth_userfield config in reloadUser method
  of atkSecurityManager. [Boy]
* Updated prototype and scriptaculous to latest stable version (1.5 and 1.7).
  [Lineke,Peter]
* atkFileAttribute: fixed bug in atkFileAttribute; if AF_OBLIGATORY and
  AF_FILE_NO_SELECT flags where both set you always had to upload a new
  image. [Bart, Peter]
* atkProfileAttribute now uses getUser() instead of $g_user global. [Boy, Ivo]
* Fixed error when calling text() on an attribute that isn't added to a
  node yet. [Guido]
* Fixed problem when adding styles to old sxw format documents in
  atkOpenDocumentWriter. [Guido]
* the atkPopup target should be passed through session_url in case the
  sessionid is passed through urls. [Guido]
* If $_SESSION[atkconfig("identifier")] is not an array, we assign an empty
  array to it to prevent session initialisation errors. [Peter, Guido]
* Fixed obligatory field checking for attributes of the atkOneToOnerelation's
  destination node by merging the validation errors from the destination
  node with the ownerinstance's errors right after performing the
  validation. [Guido]
* Fixed sudden resize of editarray when the colorpicker gets focussed
  and unfocussed in the Outlook theme. [Guido]
* Fixed style problem where the first column would be stretched to almost
  the full pagewidth, while other columns need that space much more than
  the first column. [Guido]
* Fixed a problem where attributes whould be hidden from a list because
  atkNode falsely determines you do not have the tab rights needed to see
  those attributes. (bug #615) [Yury]
* Fixed performance problem due to incorrect selectDb parameter in
  atkExportHandler. [Guido]
* Fixed several PHP Notices. [Guido]
* Added ability to implement a getExportAttributeGroup($attrname) function
  in a node to implement custom grouping in atkExportHandler. [Guido]
* Fixed problem in atkOneToOneRelation causing the record not to be
  inserted when it should be. [Guido]
* Fixed deprecated text() calls. [Guido]
* Fixed problem with the serialization of select fields in the prototype
  library. [Peter]
* Fixed small bug in Smarty Compiler which causes nameless tag attributes
  to be interpreted as an integer (sometimes) even though the value is
  surrounded by quotes. Also added some fixes for invalid quotes surrounding
  attribute names. [Peter]
* Fixed bug in recordlist: added missing (empty) cell above search button
  if no records are found. [Bart]
* Fixed support for atkDateTimeAttribute in oci8 driver. (bug #596) [Renato]
* Altered phpMailer to support CC header when using mail() function. [Bart]
* Fix for corrupt OpenOffice documents generated bij tbsooo: zip -m sometimes
  caused corrupt files. -d has better results it seems. [Ivo, Jeroen]
* Moved getTable method from atkMetaNode to atkNode. [Peter]
* Fixed 'Content-Type' header in exportFile() method, so browsers can
  determine the correct file type when downloading/opening. [Jeroen]
* atkDocumentWriter: Convert bullets to ' -' (tabs mess up layout), add extra
  line after starting,bullet-list, replace bold and italic tags within
  <li></li>. [Jeroen]
* atkNode's allowed() method now also accepts a modulename in its action
  parameter (module.node.action syntax). (bug #698) [Yury]
* Fixed bug: in an atkManyToOneRelation, all destination fields would be
  loaded instead of only the ones we need. (bug #702) [Yury]
* Fixed atkManyToManyRelation's hide() method. (bug #691) [Yury]
* Fixed bug: don't add empty cell to header if search button is not
  displayed + add empty cell when recordlist orientation=right. (bug #703)
  [Bart]
* Fixed sorting in recordlists when there are atkOneToManyRelations in the
  list. (sort of, code needs improvement). [Ivo]
* When adding records for an atkManyToManyRelation based relation,
  Initial_values() should be called on the linknode, not on the destination
  node. [Guido]
* Fixed bug in atkescape which would be too sticky if escaping between
  different nodes. [Ivo]
* Fixed reference copy bug in atkColumnConfig and added testcase. (bug #717)
  [Yury]
* Improved debug message on unknown mysql database error. (bug #715) [RainerG]

  "id" (not fixed for owner-side) and fixed where clause for checking if
  records already exist [Ivo, Jeroen]
* Fixed warning in atkManyToOneRelation (after searching) [Peter, Jeroen]
* Fixed smartsearching in atkMlAttribute [Peter,Jeroen]
* Functionally decomposed showTr. [Jeroen]
* Fixed bug in atkColumnConfig which caused the setOrderBy to be
  misinterpreted. [Peter]
* Fixed OCI auto-increment/sequence information in metadata. [Peter]
* Fixed setting m_mode in atkDb. This should always be done for atkMockDb to
  work. [Lineke]
* Fixed csv export for atkNodes. [patrick]
* Changed functionality for 'count distinct' in atkMysqlQuery (count
  did not count correctly when some of the fields where NULL) [Peter]

  other attributes which specify AF_NO_QUOTES). [Peter]
* Now using the edit format for date attributes if
  AF_DATE_STRING flag is set. [Peter]
* Admin handler now uses action of node (instead of simply
  assuming action 'admin'). [Peter]
* Fixed handling of null values in db2value method of
  atkDateTimeAttribute [Peter]
* Don't display duplicate descriptors in title session backtrace. [Peter]
* Drop-down menu now checks all rights of underlying menuitems. [Peter]

  if an error occured in the addition form). [Peter]
* Fixed fetchValue method of atkDateTimeAttribute. [Peter]
* Deprecated atkMail class (atk/utils). [Peter]
* Added proper ordering support to atkManyToOneRelation (depending
  on the order of the destination node). [Peter]
* Fixed that selectDb always loads the primary key fields even if they are
  not part of the includes list (or are part of the excludes list). [Peter]
* Fixed that actionhandler always takes the postvars and the partial values
  of the node (in the setNode) call, because most of the times handlers
  are called using their action_... function instead of handle. [Peter]
* Fixed db2value method of atkManyToOneRelation (now calls db2value on
  destination attributes). Warning: this change might give you
  problems if you depend on the old (incorrect) behaviour! [Peter]
* Check if a certain multi-record-action is allowed on a record. [Peter]
* Added excludes/includes option to atkNode::updateRecord function. [Peter]
* atkFileAttribute uses more complete record for filename mangling. [Peter]
* atkManyBoolRelation does not require atkManyToOneRelations in the
  intermediate node anymore. [Peter]
* Logout link in menu is now configurable. [Peter]
* Statefulness of DHTML tabs is now configurable. [Peter]

* atkListAttribute: check empty array with count instead of comparison
  to an empty array. [Peter]
* Added possibility for adding an additional deletion filter for the store()
  function of the atkmanytomanyrelation. [Dennis]
* atkTableRenderer supports adding an id field to a TD. [Dennis]
* atkManyToOneRelation can be configured to have AF_RELATION_AUTOCOMPLETE flag
  by default, by setting the value for $config_manytoone_autocomplete_default
  to true). [Dennis]
* The atkManyToOneRelation is now configured to always use auto-completion
  support if AF_LARGE flag is set. This can be overriden (application-wide) by
  setting $config_manytoone_autocomplete_large to false. (bug #411) [Peter]
* Improved placeFocus() JavaScript method (now focuses the real first
  form element, instead of a somewhat guess). [Peter]
* Fixed support for returning the newly created record for a many-to-one
  relation even after an edit-after-add action has been performed. [Peter]
* Added $mergeSelectors parameter to atkNode::confirmAction (defaults to
  true to be backwards compatible). [Peter]
* Use select mode for retrieval of records for atkManyToOneRelation. [Peter]
* Fetch descriptor fields early for atkManyToOneRelation so that they can
  be displayed in the title bar etc. [Dennis,Peter]
* A table cell can now have a Row and Col Span in the
  atkTableRenderer. [Sandy]
* Bug fix, if going from edit mode to view for the same record the current tab
  is only shown if it still exists in edit mode. [Dennis,Peter]
* Bug fix, handle saved form data at the session manager level instead on
  a lower level (which caused all sorts of problems, e.g. forgotten data,
  data that shouldn't be there etc.). [Dennis,Peter]
* If add handler is called directly the user can return to a new add form
  after saving the first one. [Dennis,Peter]
* Properly handle attribute postvars in add, save, edit and update handler
  after getting back from for example the select handler. [Dennis,Peter]
* In advanced search labels are always shown (before AF_NO_LABEL was used to
  determine if a label should be shown). [Lineke]
* Made the new 'modern' menu the default menu in new installations. [Boy]
* Fixed: Open Office document generator. On some systems unzip and zip would
  return -1 instead of 0 on succesfull completion. However, no actual
  information found on the internet to back this up). [Dennis, Guido]
* atkImportHandler now uses charset from languagefile to convert the imported
  file to the correct charset. [Lineke]
* Fixed some tests. [Sandy]
* Tests are only harvested in the testcases directory. [Sandy]
* Moved atkselector from the default sessionmembers to the pagevars as it
  should not be propagated to deeper session levels. [Dennis-Jan]
* Added ability to pass default to getAttribute method of atkTheme and made
  atkTheme search for icons with extension .png and .jpeg too, preferring
  png over gif and gif over jpeg. [Boy]
* Made atkPage output XHTML valid, made ATK support themes defining the
  doctype as a theme attribute, made ATK support a page.tpl, which is a
  general template to render a page in. [Boy]
* Made login page use login.css if available and made login form more
  XHTML compliant. [Boy]
* Added loadDispatch method to atkNode, which loads the output in atkOutput
  but doesn't actually flush anything and make it support a dispatch.tpl
  template if available. [Boy]
* Made index.php support themes with 'useframes' attribute (defaults to true),
  loading themes with this attribute set to false without frames,
  please update your index.php from atk/skel/index.php. [Boy]
* atkPlainMenu now supports themes and configurations which set a different
  'menufile' (defaults to menu.php) and different 'menu_params'
  (defaults to 'target="main"'). [Boy]
* atkPlainMenu now has getMenu member function which returns the menu without
  sending it to the output stream. [Boy]
* Made url functions session_vars and session_url output &amp; instead of &
  to ensure XHTML compliance. [Boy]
* Added atkGetModules() function. [Jeroen,Boy]
* Exporthandler now decodes export to charset in languagefile. Added parameter
  to customrecordlist to set decoding on or off. [Lineke]
* Showtitlerow checkbox is now taken into account in customrecordlist. Added
  parameter to customrecordlist to set showtitlerow. [Lineke]
* Changed display function of onetomanyrelation and manytomanyrelation to
  correctly show data in csv export (without html). [Lineke]
* Added assignExportData magic method to atkNode to add extra data to the CSV
  export. This lets you use a custom query to add extra info to the export.
  [Lineke]
* Made testreporter support finding and running the test for a single class,
  in ATK notation (module.mymodule.utils.utilclass) by using the 'class'
  REQUEST variable. If found, the framework won't traverse
  the entire application, but just check for a testcase in the underlying
  testcases directory and load that testcase up.
  Example: test.php?class=atk.ui.atkpage which will load up
  atk/ui/testcases/class.test_atkpage.inc. [Boy]
* Security: Fixed cross-site scripting (xss) vulnerability in Login screen and
  any other screen that made use of the makeHiddenPostvars method. (bug #697)
  [Ivo]
* It is only allowed to set the focus if the node allowes it. [Dennis-Jan]
* Fixed OCI db driver unique constraint information in metadata (only use the
  unique flags for fields that are unique on their own). [Peter]
* Use createQuery on the node db instance to create a query object for unique
  field set validation instead of using the default db instance. [Peter]
* atkManyToOneRelation::populate now support list of attribute names. [Peter]
* Bugfix in importhandler, mb_convert_encoding function is not always present.
  So we check if the function exists. [Lineke]
* Bugfix: atkMessageQueue messages are now also displayed in adminpages. [Ivo]
* Bugfix: atkformdata should be kept in the session because the window might
  be forked. [Jeroen,Peter]
* Remember atktab in atkformdata because it might be changed in the current
  edit session. [Jeroen,Peter]
* Bugfix: atkMysqliQuery should enclose the FROM clause in parentheses due to
  changes in MySQL 5.0.15 to make MySQL more compliant with the standard.
  See: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=13551 [Dennis]
* Fixed issue in MySQL driver which caused connections to be re-used
  even though we connect to a different database. [Peter]
* Fixed some PHP5 notices. [Peter]
* Added getAttributes function to the atkStringParser, same as getFields but
  if a relation is referenced using a dot only returns the attribute name
  before the dot. [Sandy,Peter]
* Fixed bug in the atkFileAttribute that made Apache segfault when uploading
  2 or more files (and use a template). [Sandy,Peter]
* Added array initialization in class.atkdb.inc due to PHP5 notice. [Patrick]
* AtkMlWrapper attribute clone fix: check phpversion and use right clone
  method based on this (check http://www.acko.net/node/54) [Nico]
* AtkMlWrapper getRecordForLng fix: first check if record is empty [Nico]
* Fixed: Saving a node with a atkmanytomanyrelation sometimes caused an SQL
  error. [Dennis]
* When $config_authentication is set to "none", a login box is no longer
  displayed. (bug #771) [Marlon]
* When $config_authentication is set to "none", a forced login with a username
  is no longer possible (so it becomes impossible to impersonate a
  non-existing user). (bug #772) [Marlon]
* Replaced deprecated DB_ACCESSDENIED with DB_ACCESSDENIED_DB constant in
  several drivers. (bug #640) [Ivo]
* Added missing include in atkManyToOneTreeRelation. (bug #680) [Guido]
* Bugfix: Added missing $page = &atkInstance("atk.ui.atkpage"); statement in
  atkModernMenu. (bug #778) [Guido]
* Optimized atkTheme->getIconFileFromModuleTheme when
  $this->m_theme['modulefiles'] is not set. [Guido]
* Fixed several php notices. [Guido,Ivo]
* atkQuery::betweenCondition method now supports a $quote parameter to toggle
  the use of quotes in the condition. (defaults to true). (bug #678) [Yury]
* Fixed bug when NF_CACHE_RECORDLIST was used. (bug #681) [Yury]
* When NF_EDITAFTERADD is used, the 'save' button now displays 'save and edit'
  so the user knows what will happen. (bug #684) [MichaelZ]
* Updated Italian translation. [Fabio]
* Updated Dutch translation. [Guido, Lineke. Ivo]
* Updated German translation. (bug #685) [MichaelZ]
* Fixed translation of tab names in error messages in an edit form. In such
  a message only the tab_$tabname translation was attempted, now it also
  tries to translate $tabname itself. [Guido]
* Changed display in "plain" mode for the atkManyToManyRelation and the
  atkOneToManyRelation. This displaymode will now give a comma-seperated
  list of the linked records descriptors in the destinationnode (just like
  CSV mode does). [Guido]
* Added atkiputils class which provides functions to validate ip numbers
  and convert them from strings to 32bit numbers and back. [Guido]
* Fixed AF_UNIQUE checking; an empty value for a unique field should not
  generate an error about the value not being unique. [Guido]
* Fixed validation break when a custom validate function on a node
  triggers an error. This caused errors not to be shown until the custom
  validate function didn't trigger errors anymore. [Guido]
* Added NF_TREE_AUTO_EXPAND flag to atkTreeNode. This flag causes the
  tree to be expanded automatically when loaded. [Guido]
* Changed achievo_modern and outlook themes to remove the padding/margin
  from the atkManyBoolRelation and atkOneToManyRelation display output.
  [Guido]
* Make sure Sender is set in atkMailer class so that the Return-Path header
  in the e-mail message has a proper value. [Patrick]
* Fixed selectDb optimization and php notice in atkViewHandler. [Guido]
* Updated action_admin() api in atkTreeNode. [Guido]
* Fixed pre mysql 5 problem in the dbconfigs user grants testcase. [Guido]
* atk*Db->connect should return the doConnect() result. [Guido]
* The atkMysqlDb::disconnect method now closes the MySQL link. [Marlon, Peter]
* Renamed registerNodeHandler to atkRegisterNodeHandler and renamed
  getNodeHandler to atkGetNodeHandle. Old functions are still
  available but deprecated. Also, atkRegisterNodeHandler gets handler parameter
  by reference in stead of by value. If you want to set register the name of
  the handler in stead of the object itself, you should pass the name in a
  variable. [Lineke]
* Make sure ATK really saves and loads NULL values as NULL in/from the database
  instead of empty strings. [Peter]
* atkNodeValidator should only skip the current record for unique constraints
  if the validation mode is not 'add'. [Peter]
* Fixed IE7 support for ATK drop-down menu. [Peter, Almer]
* Fixed translation of labels in the atkPrintableRecordlist. [MichaelA]
* Refactored atkNumberAttribute::getSearchCondition for re-use. [Peter]
* Fixed bug in atkDateAttribute where db instance was retrieved
  using atkGetDb instead of $this->getDb. [Peter]
* Fixed searching for dates. [Peter]
* Improved Autonumbering in the atkFileAttribute. (bug #792) [Sandy]
* Added passing of preferred extension to iconPath method
  of atkTheme. [Boy,Laurence]
* Order in atkNode::selectDb can now completely be disabled by
  passing false for the order parameter. This means even the
  default order is not used. [Peter]
* atkDateTimeAttribute atkDateAttribute and atkTimeAttribute now use NULL
  instead of 'NULL' when checking for empty fields. [Dennis, Peter]
* The default value for empty time fields in atkDateTimeAttribute has changed
  from date("H:s") to "". [Dennis]
* Fixed: The validation function of atkDateTimeAttribute now first transforms
  the datestring into an array (if it isn't allready) before passing the data
  to the validation function of dateAttribute and timeAttribute.
  This prevents the time-part of the string from being corrupted. [Dennis]
* Added an extra check in formselect.js if an action is set. [Dennis]
* Added onload script updateSelectable() in atkrecordlist.js to prevent a user
  from being able to post the MRA form without selecting an action
  first. [Dennis]
* Fixed: validateUniqueFieldSets() check did not handle manytoonrelations
  correctly. [Peter,Dennis]
* Fixed translation of 'error_uniquefieldset', 'this fields' should have
  been 'these fields'. [Dennis]
* Fixed: translation of tabs in error messages. [Dennis]
* In atkAttribute the registerDependees function is now only called if the
  attribute is not hidden. [Peter, Dennis]
* When addListColumn is called in the atkM2ORelation, the flag AF_FORCE_LOAD
  is added to the attribute itself, to make sure the added listcolumns are
  loaded. [Peter,Dennis]
* Fixed reference copy bug in atkActionHandler. The $handler parameter that is
  passed to action_...() overrides is now a true reference. [Ivo]
* Overhauled the way the atkSaveHandler handles redirects; when validation
  fails, the user is no longer redirected to hardcoded 'admin' or 'add' pages,
  but to the previous action, whichever that was. [Ivo]
* Added atkTimeZoneAttribute for selecting a timezone. Translations for each
  timezone are placed in the ATK language files. [Dennis]
* atkDateTimeAttribute now supports the combination of an atkDateAttribute
  with AF_DATE_STRING flag and the normal atkTimeAttribute. [Peter]
* atk_var_dump now uses var_dump internally so that references
  are displayed properly. [Peter]
* atkNode::editArray: fallback to postvars is only done if a field really
  is not set in the defaults record. [Peter]
* Fixed typo in test/class.atktestsuite.inc (bug #806) [Yury, Patrick]
* Fixed htmlentities bug in atkAttribute (bug #807) [Yury]
* Fixes in atkOneToOneRelation validation: Only add 'atkerror' record when 1:1
  relation contains error.  And array_merge returns 'null' when one of the
  arguments is not an array (cast to array fixes this) [Jeroen]
* Sort m_cascadingAttribs after removing an attribute.
  The loop in deleteDb will fail if keys are not successive. [Jeroen]
* Force update on attribute, when it is in the include-list of updateDb
  (if 'needsUpdate' returns false, but attribute is in $includes, update it
  anyway) [Jeroen]
* The module of an atkNode is now also available in the constructor of the node
  through the atkModule::getModuleScope() method. [Peter, Dennis]
* Refactored handling the view mode of attributes in atkAttribute, atkNode,
  atkEditHandler and atkViewHandler. Added class atkViewEditBase between the
  atkActionHandler and the atkEditHandler / atkViewHandler which contains
  methods only used by the Edit and View handlers. [Yury, Dennis, Peter]
* Refactored the tooltip functionality for attributes. [Yury]
* Sections in atkNode get an id instead of a number. [Patrick]
* Sections with only hidden attributes are hidden completely. [Patrick, Peter]
* Sections which are unhidden will appear expanded. [Patrick, Peter]
* Added atkArrayDiff which returns differences (atkArrayCompare returned true
  on differences) [Jeroen]
* $quote_style must default to ENT_COMPAT, not to null [Jeroen]
* Added ability to pass parmeters to atknew for constructor of class you are
  trying to create. [Boy]
* Improved displaying of error messages in OCI8 driver. [Boy]
* Added ability to specify interval instead of steps in atkTimeAttribute.
  [Boy]
* NF_LOCK now works when a database is used that supports transactions. [Ivo]
* Remove stripslashes from db2value in atkAttribute. It is no longer needed and
  selectDb's went wrong when fields contain slashes [Ivo, Jeroen]
* Updated FCK editor to latest version (2.41). [Harrie]
* Fixed corrupted images of outlook theme. [Dennis]
* ATK buttons now have a default class of "btn" if no explicit class has
  been specified. [Peter]
* Fixed detection of database type for atkTextAttribute. [Peter]
* Improved binding of variables in atkOci9Db driver. [Peter]
* Improved atkAttribute::partial_refresh method, now only refreshes
  if a new value has been selected for the depended field and a field
  will be still marked as erroneous after a refresh. [Peter]
* Updated some of atkImportHandler's code to the 21st century. [Peter]
* atkMessageQueue::addMessage now supports a second parameter $type
  which can be set to AMQ_SUCCESS, AMQ_FAILURE or the default
  AMQ_GENERAL depending on the kind of message. [Peter]
* {atkmessages} Smarty plug-in now fills $atkmessages with an array
  for each entry containing the message and the type (as string, e.g
  'success', 'failure' or 'general'). Updated themes to reflect this
  change. [Peter]
- Deprecated method to set the selected value for an atkListAttribute.
  Please use the setInitialValue method or the already existing
  intial_value meachanism instead. [Peter]
- Removed old treeicon code from atkTreeNode. [Guido]
- Temporarily removed the 'generate title row' checkbox in atkExportHandler as
  it isn't yet implemented. [Guido]
- Removed default theme's action_view.tpl as it basically is no different
  than the default action.tpl. [Ivo]
- Removed unused summary string ($total) from atkNavigator. [Guido]
- Removed dirty hack from atkManyToOneRelation for the return $value of
  the select handler (select link) or add handler (add link). This hack
  still exists for the classic AF_LARGE mode. [Dennis, Peter]
- Removed atksecure from colorpicker.inc. [Lineke]
- Removed unneeded function call from newNode function. [Maurice]
- Removed unneeded global $vars from atkModule::newNode and
  atkModule::nodeOverloaders. [Maurice]
- Removed unused code in atkDataDecode function. [Lineke]
- Deprecated atkWysiwygAttribute (in favor of atkFckAttribute). [Ivo]
- Deprecated "mysql41" db driver. (use the "mysqli" driver instead). [Peter]

+ Added ability to set a CSS class per row, column or cell in
  atkTableRenderer. [Guido]
+ Added reloadapp(); function which can be used to reload all the frames in
  the application. [Boy]
+ Added support for user-level language setting. [Boy]
+ All relationships based on atkManyToManyRelation now have better localKey
  and remoteKey detection. The use of setRemoteKey and setLocalKey is no
  longer necessary if the foreign keys have the same name as the relation
  with _id appended to it. [Ivo]
+ Added atkManyBoolRelation::setCols() method to set the number of columns
  containing checkboxes. [Ivo]
+ Added new lesson (9) to demo application to demonstrate many-to-many
  relationships. [Ivo]

+ Added optional $module parameter to atkUI and atkTheme methods that
  retrieve path information about theme files. [Ivo]

  number of numbers and the number of special characters. [Guido]
+ Added atkPasswordAttribute->generatePassword function which replaces the
  deprecated makePassword function. generatePassword is an object-function
  which generates passwords using the given length and restrictions set on
  the attribute. It is also possible to specify wheter the generated
  password should be easy to remember or as random as possible. [Guido]
+ Added Password forgotten option to allow users to regain access by asking
  the atk application to mail back a new password. To enable this feature,
  $config_auth_usernode, config_auth_emailfield and
  $config_auth_enablepasswordmailer should be set. (bug #471) [Guido]

  when AF_LARGE is set. (bug #431) [Ivo]
+ Added auto wildcard detection in atkAttribute which allows the user to use
  wildcards (*) in any search string. (bug #611) [Ivo]
* Fixed bug in the mysql41 driver. The linkid wasn't cleared after closing
  the db connection which caused unexpected behaviour. [Martin]
* Significant performance enhancement in atkNode::searchDb(). Only string/text
  type fields are searched now. [Ivo]
* Rewrote theme engine, with the following improvements:
   + Full inheritance: themes can now derive from eachother so they only
     need to define the differences from the base theme.
   + Fully automatic theme structure scanning. Themedef.inc no longer needs
     to define which templates/styles/images etc. it implements. (bug #543)
   + Support for module specific theme files.

     ($config_defaulttheme = "modname.themename");
   * atkTheme/atkThemeCompiler codebase is about half as big.
   * Compiled themefiles are now better human readable.
   * Bug where "highlight" attribute definitions would not be loaded is
     fixed.
* When displaying an image with the atkFileAttribute a random number is added
  to the img src tag in order to prevent browser caching. [Wim]
* Changed the copydb method by filtering the executetriggers and added support
  for different modes. [Dennis-Jan, Peter]
* Introduced atkeditlng url variable which can be passed along to force ML
  attributes to display a specific language. [Boy]
* Fixed a bug in the 'remove current file' feature of atkFileAttribute when
  AF_FILE_PHYSICAL_DELETE was set. [Ivo]
* Fixed CSV import handler for date values and other complexer attribute
  types. (bug #502) [Ivo]
* In CSV import sample, the raw value is no longer displayed if it is equal
  to the parsed value. [Ivo]
* Fixed import of atkManyToOneRelation values from CSV files. (bug #669) [Ivo]
* atkNode's validateFilter method can now cope with sql 'IN' operator.
  [Yury]
* Also collect timing info at debuglevel 0 for mailreports. [Boy]
* Fixed php warning in atkMlNumberAttribute. [Ivo]
* Fixed error in triggerError method when atkLanguage was not imported. [Ivo]
* Fixed table definition of lesson 7 of the demo application. [Ivo]
* Fixed bug where postDelete trigger would be called twice. [Peter, Sandy]
* The preDelete trigger will now be called separately for each (to be)
  deleted record (instead of being called only once with the complete
  recordset). THIS CHANGE IS NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE! [Peter, Sandy]
* Fixed loading of the correct tab when 'atktab' is passed in the URL. [Boy]
* Fixed loading of tests from modules outside the application root which
  would sometimes do tests twice. [Boy]
* atkManyToManyRelation based relations can now be properly hidden in forms.
  (bug #666) [Yury]
* atkManyToManyRelation based relations now only retrieve those fields used
  in the descriptor and primary key. (bug #666) [Yury]
* atkManyToManyRelation based relations no longer insert bogus records when
  the intermediary node had a separate primary key. (bug #338) [Ivo]
* Refactored atkManyBoolRelation's store(), hide(), searchCondition(),
  search() and isEmpty() methods to atkManyToManyRelation as these methods
  are not atkManyBoolRelation specific. [Ivo]
* Fixed bug in the atkManyToManyRelation when the filter isn't set. [Sandy]
* The atkdebugger is now passed an atkprevlevel of 0 instead of the
  originating atklevel (which caused it to lose its debugging info). [Boy]
* atkMLSplitter now uses atklng variable instead of deprecated lng variable.
  [Boy]
* Fixed atkBoolRelation; if unchecked, the value is 0 instead of NULL. [Sandy]
* Added baseclass include for the atkMockQuery. [Martin]
* Fixed a notice that users with Norton Internet Security or other popup
  blockers (that remove headers) may see. [Ivo]
* Link id is no longer passed to mysql error functions if it is null. [Boy]
* Fixed creating sequences in postgresql. [Sandy]
* Postgresql records are now fetched in PGSQL_ASSOC mode (only associative
  array instead of numerical indexes). This should save a lot of memory.

Changes in ATK 5.5
------------------
+ Added class atkMail for sending e-mails just like the normal mail function
  does, but with the ability to disable the sending of e-mails (and in the
  future send e-mails to other addresses etc.) for debugging purposes.
  [Peter]
+ Added support for configuration file overrides by other sections. [Peter]
+ Made atkErrorHandler put notices and php5 strict errors into the atk debug
  log so developers can see them. [Guido]
+ Added validate() method to atkDateTimeAttribute so both the date and time
  parts can be validated upon input. [Lineke]
+ Flags for the atkDateTimeAttribute are now also passed to its internal
  atkDateAttribute and the atkTimeAttribute. [Lineke]
+ Added setForceUpdate() method to atkAttribute to force update of its value
  upon save. [Boy]
+ Added 'mock' database drivers for testing purposes. [Boy]
+ Added atkMockNode to emulate a node, for testing purposes. [Ivo]
+ Added atkTestCase baseclass for unittests, that features the ability to
  replace database connections, nodes and the securitymanager with mock
  objects. [Ivo, Boy]
+ Added ability to pass ?atkmodule=modname to test.php to run only the tests
  of a specified module. [Ivo]
+ Added addFallbackModule() method to atkLanguage. [Ivo]
+ Added collapsible groups feature to atkProfileAttribute. [Harrie]
+ Added 'select all/select none' buttons per group in atkProfileAttribute.
  [Harrie]
+ Added tab security. It is now possible to grant/prevent access to a single
  tab of a node. [Harrie]
+ Added atkSetNode() counterpart for atkGetNode(), to set nodes to a different
  instance at runtime. [Ivo]
+ Added atkSetSecurityManager() counterpart for atkGetSecurityManager(), to set
  the securitymanager to a different instance at runtime. [Ivo]
+ Added flag AF_RELATION_NO_NULL_ITEM for atkManyToOneRelation to hide the
  select_none option. [Dennis]
+ The {atktext} smarty plugin now features parsing in arbitrary values into a
  translation by passing the translated string to a stringparser. [Ivo]
+ Added flag AF_MANYBOOL_AUTOLINK to atkManyBoolRelation which shows an add
  link which can be used to add records to the referenced node (if the user
  is allowed to do so). [Guido]
+ Added translations for critical and unknown errors. [Guido]
+ Added convenience methods text() to atkNode and atkAttribute. [Ivo, Peter]
+ Added $config["automenu"] for meta module. If set to false, the meta module
  does not add any default menuitems. Defaults to true. [Ivo]
+ atkNode now has built-in detection of trigger reruns, so even if triggers
  such as postAdd are called twice, it only runs on the first call. [Ivo]

  should change its realm to allow logout. [ChristianH, Ivo]
+ Added the ability to reset a database connection. [Boy]

* Moved the modifier calling functionality to atkModule. This makes it
  possible to implement a generic modifier in a module that can handle any
  node from any module. [Ivo, Guido]
* If an action has no html output, the dispatcher no longer renders an html
  page. This reduces some overhead on output-less actions such as save/update/
  delete. [Ivo]
* Fixed bug in the search functionality of the atkManyBoolRelation. [Stefano]
* Fixed translation for the title of the 'select' action. [Lineke]
* Passed along atkprevlevel to debugger window so the stack doesn't get forked
  causing the console window to draw a blank page. [Boy]
* If no link_select_node translation is found atkManyToOneRelation tries a
  generic translation of 'select_a' followed by the node name. [Boy]
* If no title_module translation is found, atkProfileAttribute will use
  the module name itself as translation. [Ivo]
* If extended searching is called directly the resultlist is nested in the
  session so after editing we return directly to the results. [Boy]
* atkTimeAttribute now properly distinguishes between '0:00' hours and empty
  values. [Ivo]

  [Lineke]
* Fixed a Smarty regular expression to support '0 params'. [Lineke]
* Fixed a bug in Smarty's core.read_cache_file.php. More information:
  http://www.phpinsider.com/smarty-forum/viewtopic.php?t=4188&highlight=
  smartytplfunc. [Lineke]
* Fixed AF_UNIQUE check in atkNodeValidator (used postvars instead of record
  for validation). [Peter]
* Fixed some outlook tree icons that were corrupted. [Lineke]
* Recordlist icon names are now assumed to be lowercase. [Ivo]
* atkTheme attributes are now case insensitive. [Ivo]
* atkOneToManyRelation now builds the referential where clause in a separate
  overridable method _getLoadWhereClause(). [Ivo]

* atkManyToOneRelation now uses primary key field as default order if no order
  was specified. [Lineke]

  (used to be record-independent). [Lineke]
* Fixed translation of atkDateAttribute when the current language was changed
  at runtime. [Ivo]
* Fixed memory leak with debugger set at level 2 where session would be
  stuffed with debug data. [Boy,Sandy]
* Reduced memory consumption of traces by replacing &nbsp; with plain space
  as the preformat tag already takes care of proper formatting. [Guido]
* Fixed html tag delimiters ('<' and '>') in traces being interpreted
  by the browser when present in atk_get_trace("html") output. Now they
  are replaced by html entities (&gt; and &lt; respectively). [Guido]

Changes in ATK 5.3RC1
---------------------
+ Added support for the atkMetaNode to the Oracle (OCI) driver. [Peter]

  strings at this time and only on PostgreSQL and Oracle). [Peter]
+ Added relation support to the atkMetaPolicy (supports one-to-one,
  one-to-many and many-to-one relations). [Peter]
+ Added get/setDescriptorTemplate methods to atkNode and atkRelation. [Peter]

  English strings (e.g. dogs => dog, dog => dogs etc.). [Peter]
+ Added AF_ONETOMANY_EMBED, this causes the add to be embedded in the current
  node, instead of displaying it on a seperate screen. [Boy]

Note: The CHANGES file has not been accurately updated until the release of
ATK 5.0. The changes below are rough feature indications.

Changes in ATK 4.0 Light
------------------------
ATK 4 was the PHP4 release of ATK. The light version was the version that has
accompanied Achievo (http://www.achievo.org) from approx. 0.6 to 1.1, and was
not publically available outside of Achievo. A detailed changelog has not
been kept. Most changes can be traced back to entries in Achievo's CHANGES
file.

Changes in ATK 3.0 Light
------------------------
ATK 3 was the first publicly available release, but only as part of
Achievo. based on PHP3. All was new, so a list of changes is not present.
