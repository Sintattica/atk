Changes in ATK 6.4
------------------
* Changed the behaviour of the dateattribute. I can't expain why, nothing
  has changed recently but it suddenly returned the current date when
  you left it blank while using extended search or adding records. Causing
  the search to break and new records always contain the current date.
  Hope this change doesn't break things. If you have any issues let
  me know. [Martin]
+ Added the possibility to implement the methods handleUpdateSuccess
  and/or handleUpdateError in your node to override the normal behavior
  of atkUpdateHandler after updating a record. For example to redirect
  to something else. [Peter]
* Fixed input field size in atkNumberAttribute and atkMySQLi driver for
  numeric columns with decimals. [Peter]
+ Added new fluent interface for setting meta policy attribute properties.
  The interface allows you to modify attributes in all ways the normal meta
  policy supports, but also adds support for inserting attributes before/after
  (insertBefore/insertAfter) attributes or at the top/bottom 
  (insertAtTop/insertAtBottom) of all attributes. The interface is returned
  when calling atkMetaPolicy::get with one or more attribute names or as the
  result of a call to add, addFieldSet, hasOne and hasMany. [Peter]
* Fixed bug in atkEditHandler which allowed you to edit non-existing records
  without giving any warning whatsoever. [Peter]
* Fixed bug in atkModule::menuitem which caused menu items with an explicit
  null parent menu, not to be added to the main menu. [Peter]
* Fixed bug in meta node handeling of password attributes, which incorrectly
  always were made obligatory. [Peter]
+ Added "alwaysShowGrid" option to the atkDGList component to always show
  the list header in embed mode, even if there are no records. [Peter]
+ Added atkDataGrid::setComponentOption method to set an option for
  an existing datagrid component without having to overwrite the
  entire component definition. [Peter]
+ Added AF_ONETOONE_RESPECT_TABS flag for the atkOneToOneRelation which
  makes it possible to respect the tabs set in the master node for the
  1:1 relation in integration mode. [Peter]
+ Added methods for removing filters to atkDataGrid, e.g.
  atkDataGrid::removeFilter and atkDataGrid::removeFilters. [Peter]
+ Added an option to atkNode::countDb, atkNode::selectDb and atkSelector
  to ignore the default filters that have been set on a node. [Peter]
* atkDataGrid now makes sure that it doesn't set filters twice, when
  retrieving data for the grid, by using the new ignoreDefaultFilters() 
  switch in atkSelector. [Peter]   
* atkStringParser now has an option to disable the replacing of unknown
  fields with an empty string. This is used for record action URL's which
  can otherwise not easily contain array-based parameters. [Peter]
* $config_meta_caching is in skel/config.inc.php by default disabled because 
  if you start developing a new application, your tables are  still in flux. 
  Having this option enabled by default causes a lot of confusion. Next to 
  this the performance impact isn't huge, so even if people forget to enable 
  this option it isn't a big deal (but if you are reading this, you should 
  enable this option on production environments!). If the option is disabled 
  the debug output contains a special warning. [Peter]
* PHP 5.3 compatibility fixes. [Peter]
+ Added support for editing records in-line in a datagrid. Note: This feature 
  is still EXPERIMENTAL, at the moment there is no good validation/error 
  handeling yet. To enable this feature simply set some attributes as editable 
  using $node->setEditableListAttributes(...). [Peter]
* Make sure if someone resorts a grid on a certain column the 
  current record offset is reset to 0. [Peter]
* Added AF_BOOL_HIDE_TOOLBAR flag for atkBoolAttribute which can be
  used to hide the select all, none etc. links. [Peter]
* ATK now first searches for nodes in <module>/nodes/ and only 
  falls back to <module>/ if necessary. [Peter]
* Improved the speed of CSV imports (bug #1271) [Arjen]
* atkExportHandler now respects the current search parameters 
  (bug #1251). [Arjen, Peter]
* Fixed func_concat for OCI8 driver (bug #571). [Arjen]
* Lower attribute columns or expressions when sorting (bug #1311)
  [Arjen, Peter]
+ Added support for Microsoft's Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) 
  authentication  (bug #978). [Matthieu, Ivo]
+ Added support for displaying boolean fields as checkboxes in list/view
  mode (bug #682) [MichaelZ, Peter]
* Fixed import of certain CSV import files (bug #796). [Alfred]
+ Added support for specifying columns for attributes which can be used in
  the theme to show attributes in different columns (bug #1017) [Rik, Peter]
+ Added specific template for view actions in Steelblue theme, because IE was
  having some troubles with nested forms in the view action. [Tjeerd]
+ Added OnChangeHandler support for the atkfileattribute. [Tjeerd]
* Fixed sorting m2one relations. Switching between sort orders didn't
  work. Sorting was only possible in asc order. [Martin]
+ Added OnChangeHandler support for the atktimeattribute. [Martin]
+ Add 'showAll' atkDGList option. When true (default), the 'records per 
  page' option will have an 'all' option. [Marc]
* Fixed displaying of 'size' (integral part) of atkNumberAttribute. [Paul 
  Reid, Boy]
* Fixed displaying of large integer (non-decimals) numbers of 
  atkNumberAttribute (larger than 2147483647). [Paul Reid, Boy]
* Fixed (de)selecting rights in subgroups [Jeroen]
* Changed atkUrlEncode and atkUrlDecode functions to allow encoding a string
  9 times instead of 4. Also added some testcases to verify the expected
  behaviour of these functions. [Guido]
