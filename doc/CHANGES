Changes in ATK 6.5
------------------
* Fixing a Javascript bug, causing various IE versions to break when using
  the calendar popup [mvdvelden]
+ Added atkLanguage::setSupportedLanguages which makes it more easy to write
  tests for a certain language, but can also be used to explicitly set the
  supported languages instead of relying on auto-detection. [Peter]
* Use proper labels for atkManyBoolRelation which makes selecting checkboxes
  much easier. [Peter]
* Making atkonetoonerelation listen to tabs in view mode when the
  AF_ONETOONE_INTEGRATE is not set or when the AF_ONETOONE_RESPECT_TABS is
  set. [Melvin]
+ Added atkPage::getLoadScripts() which returns the currently loaded load
  script codes. [Peter]
+ Added $offset option to atkPage::register_load_script to register a
  script at a certain offset. [Peter]
* atkMetaPolicy::add now has a default value for the attribute type. [Peter]
* Making the autoloader work with strings with forward slashes (preg_quote 
  doesn't seem to resolve the problem). [pmatthews]
* Added $force option to atkCache::getInstance which can be used to force
  creating a new instance. Can be helpful for test-cases and such. [Peter]
* Added $fallback option to atkCache::getInstance which can be used to
  disable the graceful fallback to var cache. [Peter]
* Made atkSelectHandler also execute the modifyGrid action. [Boy]
* Fixed atkNode::validateFilter, was unable to spaces in the filter and made
  it emit warnings if it fails a filter. [Boy]
+ Added option to atkDgList to set the columns to be displayed, with support
  for atkManyToOneRelation 'list columns'. [Boy]
* atkNode::deleteDb now emits a warning if there is nothing to delete. [Boy]
+ Added atkConfig::setGlobal and atkConfig::getGlobal to set and get the
  value of global configuration parameters. [Peter]
+ Added support for specifying a database driver outside atk/db using a fully 
  qualified ATK class path. [Peter]
+ Added full support for PHPUnit based tests, for detailed information on
  setting things up see atk/skel-tests/README. [Peter]
- Removed SimpleTest, please note that this change is in no way backwards
  compatible. If you need to run SimpleTest tests you should use an older
  version of ATK or migrate your tests to PHPUnit. [Peter]
* Separating the generate link logic from the display record logic in the
  atkmanytomanyselectrelation with the aim of allowing link customisation 
  [pmatthews]
* Made atkFileAttribute::getFiles throw an error if the directory is not 
  readable. [Boy]
+ Added atkFileUtils::getFileMimetype, to get the mimetype of a file using
  the fileinfo extension or mime_content_type function. [Boy]
* Always displaying newlines for destination descriptors 
  in atkmanytomanyselectrelation [pmatthews]
* Don't show relations as link in list mode for atkManyToOneRelations with
  AF_MANYTOONE_AUTOLINK flag (only in view/edit mode). [Peter]
* Fixing atknode->validateFilter to cope with more complex queries and not 
  break if a table.column is used in a query but not as the first field 
  refferenced [pmatthews]
+ Adding visual prompt to orderable class.atkmanytomanyselectrelation.inc
  Defaults to images/up-down.gif, overrideable. [pmatthews]
* Exposed getAddURL as protected method on atkOneToManyRelation, allowing
  you to change the URL that is used as the 'add a new x'. [Boy]
* Filtering the results displayed in the manytomanyselectrelation so you don't
  get multiple entries for the same relation. This ususally happens when you
  add more than one result between saving. [pmatthews]
* Fixed the lack of support for NF_NO_ADD and NF_NO_DELETE 
  on atkmanytomanyselectrelation. [pmatthews]
* Fixed atkDirectoryTraverser warnings on reading unreadable dirs. [Dennis]
+ Set the time locale based on the locale specified in the language file. [Peter]
* Changed default charset for "nl" to UTF-8. [Peter]
* Added record caching to atkViewEditBase::getRecord(). The record is now cached
  as long as the handler instance exists, unless we call getRecord with a  
  boolean true argument. This forces the record to be fetched again. [Matthijs]
+ Added setSalt and getSalt methods to the atkPasswordAttribute to allow using
  a salt when encoding the passwords [Harrie]
* Fixed atkSessionManager::stackVar so that it doesn't keep overwriting the
  current value with a request var value on subsequent calls. [Peter]
* Fixed atkGetNode/newNode to always force a lower-case node path. [Peter]
* atkMetaPolicy now throws an exception when a destination (or link) node 
  or a certain attribute class cannot be found. [Peter]
+ Added atkNode::registerRecordActionsCallback(). This makes it possible to 
  manipulate the record actions for a grid from outside of a node. The 
  callback function has the same signature as atkNode::recordActions(). 
  Overriding atkNode::recordActions() is also still possible. [Matthijs]
+ Added atkAttribute::addDependency which replaces atkAttribute::addDependee
  and allows you to register a callback which is both called on the initial
  add/edit form generation and when the attribute changes value. The
  callback is passed a special helper object which allows you to use PHP
  calls to hide, show and/or refresh one or more attributes or output
  JavaScript code which does some more DOM modifications. [Peter]
* Deprecated atkAttribute::addDependee, for now it will create a dependency
  with a callback which refreshes the depended attribute. [Peter]
+ Added atkAttribute::preAddToEditArray which can be used to make some 
  last-minute modifications to the record or attribute. This makes it
  for example possible for the atkManyToOneRelation to pre-load it's
  selectable records and update the record to already select the first
  record (on add, when no default value is set and the relation is
  obligatory). This can be used by other (depended) attributes to render
  themselves based on that information. [Peter]
- Removed atkAttribute::setManualPaint because it was already been replaced
  for a while now with the attribute disabled mode. [Peter]
* Added $config_autoload_reindex_on_missing_class configuration option, to
  disable the auto re-indexing of all ATK class files when PHP detects
  a missing class. This means you should manually delete the cached 
  atktmp/classes.inc file on an ATK update or turn this option on, the
  default is off. [Peter]
+ Added support for setting a position attribute/column for a many-to-many
  select relation. When set, the selected records can be re-arranged using
  simple drag & drop and their positions are saved in the database. 
  [Paul, Peter]
+ Added MySQLi and MySQL specific escaping. [mvdvelden]
* Fixed warning when registering a custom actionHandler. [Tjeerd]
+ Added setAutoSearch() to atkManyToOneRelation and atkListAttribute. When set
  to true and the attribute is rendered onto a datagrid search form, the
  attribute will automatically refresh the datagrid it belongs when its onchange
  event occurs. [Matthijs]
* atkOneToManyRelation::storeAdd() now resets the datagrid session store after a
  successful save of the relation. Otherwise, when adding a new parent record
  in certain situations, the relation would show previously added records
  from the old session in the relation datagrid. [Matthijs]
* Changed some atkAttribute methods to return their instance for easy chaining
  of methods. [mvdvelden]
* Fixed tableExists in the mysqli driver to respect the database name when
  explicitly set in the table property of a metaNode. [mvdvelden]
+ Implemented atkRecycleBin, a listener that can be added to a node and that
  transfers deleted records to a recyclebin table. [Ivo]
* atkMetaPolicy now throws an exception if it can't detect a table for a node
  or if an explicitly set table does not exist. [Peter]
+ Added atkMetaPolicy::exists method which can be used to check if a certain
  attribute/column exists. [Peter]
+ Added atkNode::rowClass method which can be used to return (a) CSS
  class(es) for a datagrid list row based on record contents. [Peter]
+ Added atkHiddenAttribute for convenient addition of hidden fields to
  forms. [Ivo]
+ Added support for bind parameters to atkDatagrid::addFilter. [Peter/Tjeerd]
+ Added atkMetaPolicy::getAll() which can be used to easily add flags etc.
  to all attributes at once. [Peter]
* atkNode::getSearchCondition() now checks itself for the existence of
  a <attributename>_searchcondition() method for each attribute. If it exists,
  it gets called instead of <attribute>::getSearchCondition(). Until now it was
  only possible to change the render behaviour of an attribute search field with
  <attributename>_search, now we can also change the actual search condition
  that is generated for each attribute. [Matthijs]
+ Added atkExceptionHandler which handles uncaught exceptions with a call
  to atkHalt. [Peter]
- Removed atkNavigator because it isn't used anymore for a while now and
  contains old obsolete code. If you still need it make a copy and use
  an overloader. [Peter]
* atkErrorHandler now ignores suppressed warnings (e.g. using the @
  operator). If you explicitly ignore them in your code, it's your choice
  so ATK shouldn't display them in the debug output. [Peter]
+ Added atkSelector::getIndices() which returns the indices for the index
  field that are available for the currently set conditions. [Peter]
* atkSelector now supports ignoring primary key and/or force load fields
  and supports ignoring postvars (e.g. search criteria etc.) [Peter]
+ Added support for bind parameters and fetching rows one-by-one to
  atkSelector. Also refactored the atkNode::selectDb/countDb code into this
  class. These methods are now deprecated in favor of atkNode::select()
  which uses the atkSelector fluent interface. Made sure that if these methods
  are still being used that the calls get transformed to calls to
  atkNode::select() and if they are overridden that the overridden methods
  will be used by atkSelector. [Peter]
+ Added support for prepared statements. atkDb::prepare($query) let's you create
  a prepared statement which can use either anonymous ("id = ?") or named
  ("id = :id") bind parameters. By default the bind parameters are handled by
  ATK (e.g. replaced in the query with the proper values) but drivers with
  native bind parameter support can use real bind parameters. [Peter]
+ Added native support for bind parameters in prepared statements for the
  atkMySQLi driver. [Peter]
+ Added method atkAttribute::setForceReload(). If set to true, the
  fetched/calculated attribute value is not overwritten by the value from
  the session. Example: an expression attribute is calculated based on data
  from a relation. If the relation is updated, we don't want the attribute value
  to be overwritten by outdated session data. [Matthijs]
* Fixed a bug in atkUpdateHandler::handleUpdateSuccess() where a
  redirect would be made to the previous stack level without replacing the
  session data. This resulted in displaying old data for some relations. This
  fix makes use of SESSION_REPLACE with levelskip 1 [Matthijs]
+ made a new array available in the edit/view form template. You can
  now use $attributes which contains all attributes by their name. The
  <attributename> notation will be depricated. [Sandy]
+ atkActionHandlers now have a setBoxTemplate to set the template from your
  custom theme that renders the action.tpl. Currently only implemented in the
  add and edit handlers. [Sandy]
* SESSION_REPLACE now supports levelskips, so we can replace multiple levels
  on the sessionstack. [Tjeerd/Peter]
* Fixed bug where atkNode::updateDb() did not pass its includes and exludes on
  to atkMlSplitter::updateMlRecords(). atkMlSplitter::updateMlRecords() now
  correctly handles provided includes and excludes. [Matthijs]
+ atkDropDownMenu now supports JavaScript calls for menuitems, simply start
  your URL with "javascript:". [Peter]
* Correctly escape atkHref url's. Please note that this change might be
  backwards incompatible in the highly unlinkely event you escape the URL
  yourself beforehand. [Peter]
* Generalized atkController::getButton so you can use it for undefined
  actions (in which case the button name will be the action name). [Peter]
* Improved atkSelector::where so that multiple calls will be ANDed together
  (something you would expect it to do anyway). [Peter]
* Log system queries (like locks, metadata retrieval etc.) separately so we
  can give a distinct query count in the debug output. At the moment only
  implemented in the MySQLi driver. [Peter]
* Don't display menu and top bar for frameless themes if the request
  parameters contain the request parameter atknonav. [Peter]
* Fixed bug in atkUpdatedByAttribute for displaying the correct user in
  add/edit display mode. [Peter]
* Made SQL where clause checker aware that some parameters might be arrays
  instead of a single value. [Peter]
* Bug fixed that caused atkUpdateStampAttribute and atkCreatedStampAttribute to
  cause 'field is required' errors when the AF_OBLIGATORY flag was set [Harrie]
+ Added atkPolymorphicOneToOneRelation to atk/relations. The usage of this
  relation type is described in a HOWTO, but wasn't available in ATK [Matthijs]
* Fixed bug in atkMySQLiDb driver which caused problems when retrieving metadata
  for tables names that contain schema information. The table and schema were
  incorrectly escaped with backticks when retrieving metadata. [Matthijs]
+ Added session manager stack garbage collector which automatically removes
  stacks that haven't been used for a certain time period (controlled by
  $config_session_max_stack_inactivity_period, default: 3600s == 1h). [Peter]
* Bug fixed session leak in atkOneToManyRelation's datagrid usage. [Peter]
* Changed the behavior of smart debugging. By default if you turn smart
  debugging on by ip or by a request key the debug level will be 0 until
  you specify a different level in the URL. [Peter]
+ Added special configuration variable "debug_enabled" which can be used to
  check if debugging is enabled even though the current level might be 0.
  This can come in handy if you want to create a debug menu which you can
  use to change the different debug levels. [Peter]
* Improved behaviour of atkDummyAttribute when setting flags in the
  meta node. [Peter]
+ Added special 'atknested' request parameter which causes ATK to instantly
  redirect to the given URL with session mode SESSION_NESTED. This can be
  used to prepend something on the stack. For example, a direct add link in
  the menu which prepends the admin action so that after the user is done
  adding the record, the user is redirected to the admin screen instead of
  getting a new empty form. [Peter]
* Fixed bug in atkMySQLiDb driver which caused problems with special table
  names that need to be escaped when retrieving metadata. [Peter]
  when retrieving table metadata. [Peter]
* Themes now support the new PHP style templates too. [Peter]
* Improved tooltip support (reminder, if you add a <node>_<column>_tooltip
  entry in your text file it will be displayed as a help text when hovering
  a special help icon). [Peter]
* Small optimization to AtkStringParser->getFields(). [Matthijs]
* Removed class AtkOneToManyRelationSessionGridHandler from file
  class.atkonetomanyrelation.inc and put it into its own file.
  Otherwise the classloader couldn't properly cache this class and
  would rebuild the class list every time. [Matthijs]
* Fixed retrieval of last insert id for the MySQLi db driver.
  In certain situations where a table with an autoincrement column is used, the
  driver would return 0 instead of the newly incremented id. [Matthijs]
+ Added atkAddHandler::setSaveAction, atkSaveHandler::setAddAction,
  atkEditHandler::setUpdateAction and atkUpdatehandler::setEditAction to
  make it more easy to use these handlers inside custom actions. [Peter]
+ [EXPERIMENTAL] Added atkAttribute::observeJS($event, $body) method which
  can be used to observe JavaScript events on attribute fields. [Peter]
* Updated PrototypeJS to version 1.6.1. [Tjeerd]
* Fixed AF_DATE_STRING support in the dateattribute. Reported by
  Arjen Tebbenhof. Thanks Arjen for providing a patch and reporting this
  issue! [Arjen Tebbenhof, Martin]
+ Added data retrieval convenience methods to atkDb (getRow, getRowsAssoc,
  getValuesAssoc) which support specifying columns to use for the key
  (or value) in the result set. [Peter, Tjeerd]
* Improved getValue and getValues methods in atkDb, now support
  both numerical and string column names. [Peter, Tjeerd]
* Fixed bug in atkDb::getValue which might have caused the retrieval of
  more rows than necessary. Please specify either you own limit in the query
  or use the new $useLimit parameter and set it to true. [Peter, Tjeerd]
* Fixed parameter order in atkText call inside the sessionmanager::stacktrace
  function. [Guido]
* Fixed atkManyToOneTreeRelation: nodes on the same level weren't rendered in
  the dropdown in edit-mode. Removed globals as well. [Sandy, Jeroen]
