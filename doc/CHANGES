  OpenDocumentWriter implementation (which wraps the TinyButStrong
  OpenOffice.org template engine). [Guido]
+ Document action handler (and action icon in default theme for use in

Changes in ATK 5.3RC1
---------------------

+ Added AF_ONETOMANY_EMBED, this causes the add to be embedded in the current
  node, instead of displaying it on a seperate screen. [Boy]

  defining application wide custom baseclasses for nodes and modules. [Ivo]
+ Added atkConfig::get() for retrieving config values by section. Variables
  can be defined as $config["value"] in configs/<section>.inc.php files. [Ivo]
+ $config values can now be redirected to a runtime function by defining
  a function called config_<configkey>() or config_<modname>_<configkey>() for
  modules. [Ivo]
+ Added debug console for debugging queries. Shows explain plan, results and
  backtrace for each query performed on a page (mysql only currently).
  If debuglevel is 2, a stacktrace of each debug statement is shown. [Ivo]

* Introduced db member variable for atkQuery which is needed when using
  multiple connections. [Harrie, Boy]
* Renamed anoying isSessionIdValid() to isValidSessionId() to make
   Zend Studio's autocompletion defaults to isset(). [Martin]

Note: The CHANGES file has not been accurately updated until the release of
ATK 5.0. The changes below are rough feature indications.

Changes in ATK 4.0 Light
------------------------
ATK 4 was the PHP4 release of ATK. The light version was the version that has
accompanied Achievo (http://www.achievo.org) from approx. 0.6 to 1.1, and was
not publically available outside of Achievo. A detailed changelog has not
been kept. Most changes can be traced back to entries in Achievo's CHANGES
file.

Changes in ATK 3.0 Light
------------------------
ATK 3 was the first publicly available release, but only as part of
Achievo. based on PHP3. All was new, so a list of changes is not present.
