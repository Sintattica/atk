To create your own ATK PHPUnit test environment you should:

If this is a somewhat older ATK application (one that dates before the PHPUnit
support in ATK), you might need to grab a fresh copy of atk/skel/atk.inc for
your project.

After copying the necessary files open bootstrap.php and change the value of
$config_atkroot to your application's ATK root.

- Update your atk.inc with the atk.inc from atk/skel/.

- Open bootstrap.php and change the value of $config_atkroot
  to your application's ATK root.

- (optional) if you want to run ATK's own tests you can checkout the tests
  in the tests/ directory using the following command:

  svn co http://svn.ibuildings.nl/atk/tests/trunk atk

You now have a directory structure like the following:

  back-end/
    atk/
  tests/
    atk/
    AllTests.php
    bootstrap.php
    phpunit.xml

Before you can run any of the tests you first need to install PHPUnit. For more
information see http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/installation.html.

After you've installed PHPUnit you are ready to run ATK's tests by issuing the
following command from inside the tests/ directory:

  phpunit

This command uses the phpunit.xml to check what files / directories are
available for testing (note, this works only for PHPUnit 3.4+, otherwise
use 'phpunit AllTests.php'). If you only want to test a certain group of tests
you can use the --group command-line argument, e.g. to run only the attribute
tests, you can use the following command:

  phpunit --group ATK-Attributes

You can also exclude a group of tests, using the following command:

  phpunit --exclude-group ATK-Cache

To get a list of available groups you can issue the following command:

  phpunit --list-groups

You can customize the phpunit.xml file to include your own tests. By default
an entry is added for a directory called modules/ which can contain the
tests for your own modules. Your directory structure could for example look
like the following:

  back-end/
    atk/
    modules/
      employee/
        nodes/
          class.employee.inc
  tests/
    atk/
    modules/
      employee/
        nodes/
          EmployeeTest.php
    AllTests.php
    bootstrap.php
    phpunit.xml

You are however free to modify phpunit.xml to suit your own needs. If the
phpunit.xml file is not flexible enough for you or you are using
an older version of PHPUnit you could also choose to modify the
AllTests.php file to suit your needs.
To use the AllTests.php file to run your tests you can use
the following command:

  phpunit AllTests.php

Be aware if you use the AllTests.php approach with newer PHPUnit versions
you will lose the ability to include/exclude groups on the command-line
like in the examples above.
However you can still include/exclude groups programatically
inside your AllTests.php.
