/**
 * Attribute for keeping track of record creation times.
 *
 * The atkCreateStampAttribute class can be used to automatically store the
 * date and time of the creation of a record.
 * To use this attribute, add a DATETIME field to your table and add this
 * attribute to your node. No params are necessary, no initial_values need 
 * to be set. The timestamps are generated automatically.
 * This attribute is automatically set to readonly, and to af_hide_add 
 * (because we only have the timestamp AFTER a record is added).
 *
 * (the attribute was posted at www.achievo.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8608)
