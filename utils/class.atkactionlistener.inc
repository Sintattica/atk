/**
 * The atkActionListener baseclass for handling ATK events.
 *
 * The most useful purpose of the atkActionListener is to serve as a base
 * class for custom action listeners. Extend this class and override only
 * the notify($action, $record) method. Using atkNode::addListener you can
 * add listeners that catch evens such as records updates and additions.
 * This is much like the classic atk postUpdate/postAdd triggers, only much
 * more flexible.
