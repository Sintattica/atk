ATK Framework
=============
The ATK Framework is a special purpose PHP framework targeted at business applications. It allows you to build an application with very small amounts of code.

Its focus on business features makes it an excellent framework for HRM, CRM, data management and CMS type applications. The ATK Framework is stable and suitable for production. For more information, see the [ATK Framework GitHub project wiki](https://github.com/atkphpframework/atk/wiki) and the [ATK Framework website](http://www.atk-framework.com).

The purpose of the the [ATK Framework project on GitHub](https://www.github.com/atkphpframework/atk) is to create, as a community, the leading rapid-development framework for creating enterprise web applications, such as [Achievo](https://www.github.com/atkphpframework/achievo) for enterprise resource management. The ATK Framework was created by [ibuildings.nl](http://www.ibuildings.nl) and development is now carried on by the open source community, managed by the [GitHub atkphpframework group](https://www.github.com/atkphpframework/), with the endorsement and permission of [ibuildings.nl](http://www.ibuildings.nl).

To Get Started
==============
Applications built using the ATK Framework can be hosted on a standard web application AMP stack (Apache/MySQL/PHP), and is compatible with current AMP stack component versions (e.g. PHP 5.4.x, MySQL 5.5.x). ATK requires PHP 5.1.3 or newer.

The most convenient way to get started using the ATK Framework is to clone the [ATK Framework GitHub repository](https://github.com/atkphpframework/atk) to your webserver. The master branch, containing the most recent production release, will be automatically checked out. Besides the master branch, the repository includes a number of previous release branches, including release-6.4 which is being maintained for Achievo (until Achievo has been migrated to the current release).

If you want to learn about the ATK Framework, an [ATK Framework demo appliation](https://www.github.com/atkphpframework/atkdemo) is available. The demo is lesson-based, with the lessons covering the basic functionality and features of ATK Framework. 

Version Control and Issue Tracking
==================================
* [ATK Framework GitHub project canonical repository](https://github.com/atkphpframework/atk)
* [ATK Framework GitHub project issue tracker](https://github.com/atkphpframework/atk/issues)
* [ibuildings Achievo/ATK bugzilla](http://bugzilla.achievo.org/query.cgi) for searching historical issues prior to ATK 6.6.0 (if you find an issue that applies to the current release, please copy the pertinent details into a new GitHub issue and include a reference to the Bugzilla entry). 

Communication Channels
======================
Developers using the ATK Framework discuss problems and solutions, keep each other informed, and generally help each other out, on the [Achievo/ATK forum](http://forum.achievo.org/). It's a good idea to create a free user profile on the forum, you will need it to post topics or reply to existing topics (although viewing does not require a profile). If you create a new topic, please be careful to submit it in an ATK Framework sub-forum (not an Achievo sub-forum).
